Oka, J.\\nFACTUAL ASPECT\\n1.\\t\\nThis is a very unfortunate case. The victim of the offence was ten \\nyears old at the time of the incident. On 27th May 2009, around \\n9.00 a.m., she and her first cousin, PW-2, had gone to a pasture \\nto graze her goats. The age of PW-2 was seven years at that \\ntime. As the victim was thirsty, she went near a tubewell cabin. \\nThe appellant-accused was working as an operator of the tubewell \\nappointed by the owner of the tubewell. The victim requested the \\nappellant to provide drinking water. The allegation of the prosecution \\nis that, with evil intentions, the appellant took her inside the cabin. \\nHe committed rape on her and, after that, murdered her. According \\nto the prosecution\\u2019s case, PW-2 saw the appellant forcibly taking \\nthe victim inside the cabin and raping her. By 11.00 a.m., PW-2 \\nreturned to PW-1, the victim\\u2019s father. PW-1 was the uncle of PW-\\u00a02. \\nAfter PW-2 narrated the story to PW-1, he went to the tubewell \\ncabin to find the victim and found the dead body of the victim \\nhidden in a haystack in that cabin. On being questioned by PW-1, \\nthe appellant fled from the spot and thereafter, PW-1 registered \\nthe First Information Report. \\n2.\\t\\nThe Trial Court, by judgment and order dated 24th December \\n2012, convicted the appellant for the offences punishable under \\nSections\\u00a0376, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (for short, \\u2018the \\nIPC\\u2019). The Trial Court also convicted the appellant under the provisions \\nof Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes \\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short, \\u2018the SCST Act\\u2019). The \\nTrial Court imposed capital punishment.\\n3.\\t\\nThe High Court heard the reference under Section 366 of the Code \\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, \\u2018the CrPC\\u2019) with an appeal \\npreferred by the appellant. Though the High Court confirmed the \\nconviction, the death penalty was set aside and the appellant was \\nsentenced to undergo life imprisonment for the remainder of his \\nnatural life subject to the exercise of powers of grant of remission \\nor grant of clemency by the constitutional functionaries. \\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n341\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\n4.\\t\\nThe present appeal is against the judgments mentioned above. \\nBy order dated 20th May 2022, this Court granted bail to the \\nappellant after noting that he had undergone actual incarceration \\nfor about 13 years. We may note here that earlier, learned counsel \\nShri\\u00a0M\\u00a0Shoeb\\u00a0Alam was appointed as amicus curiae to espouse the \\ncause of the appellant. After his designation as a senior advocate, \\nhe continued to assist this Court. Shri Talha Abdul Rahman, \\nAdvocate-on-Record,\\u00a0was appointed amicus curiae to assist the \\nlearned senior counsel. \\nSUBMISSIONS\\n5.\\t\\nThe learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has \\ntaken us through the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. \\nInviting our attention to evidence of PW-1, Heera Lal, the father \\nof the victim, he pointed out that the version of the witness in his \\nexamination-in-chief is based on what was reported to him by \\nPW-2, the minor witness. But, if we compare the depositions of \\nPW-2 with the examination-in-chief of PW-1, there is a significant \\nvariance between the version of PW-2 as stated by PW-1 and what \\nPW-2 stated in his examination-in-chief. He pointed out that in the \\ncross-examination, PW-1 has tried to improve upon his version by \\ntrying to depose consistently with the version of PW-2. Inviting our \\nattention to the proceedings before the Trial Court, he submitted \\nthat when the examination-in-chief of the PW-1 was recorded, the \\nappellant-accused was not represented by any advocate. Therefore, \\nthe cross-examination was adjourned to enable the appellant to engage \\nan advocate. An advocate was appointed to espouse his cause after \\nthe examination-in-chief of PW-1 was recorded. The appellant was not \\nrepresented by any advocate at the time of the framing of the charge.\\n6.\\t\\nComing to the depositions of PW-2, the learned senior counsel for \\nthe appellant urged that considering the difference between the \\nversion of PW-1 in his examination-in-chief and cross-examination, the \\npossibility of PW-2 being tutored cannot be ruled out. He submitted \\nthat evidence of PW-2 was recorded two and half years after the \\nincident, and on the date of the recording of evidence, his age was \\nten years. Possibly, he was tutored. He pointed out that the evidence \\nof PW-2 was not of sterling quality and, therefore, cannot be the \\nsole basis for the conviction, especially when evidence regarding \\nrecovery is doubtful. \\n342\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n7.\\t\\nThe learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant as amicus \\ncuriae pointed out that the alleged recovery of the victim\\u2019s slippers \\nand underwear, at the instance of the appellant, is highly doubtful \\nas the place and time of recovery have not been mentioned in the \\nrecovery memo. The prosecution did not examine the two witnesses \\nto the recovery memo. He pointed out that the prosecution made \\nno attempt to prove that blood stains on the undergarments of the \\nappellant were that of the blood of the victim. No analysis was made. \\n8.\\t\\nMore importantly, he submitted that the incriminating circumstances \\nbrought on record in the evidence against the appellant were not put \\nto him in his examination under Section 313 of the CrPC. Therefore, \\nthe appellant\\u2019s right of defence was seriously prejudiced. He relied \\nupon a decision of this Court in the case of Raj Kumar v. State \\n(NCT of Delhi).1\\n9.\\t\\nShri K. Parameshwar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the \\nState, supported the impugned judgments. However, he has assisted \\nus on the issue of legal aid to the accused. \\nCONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS\\n10.\\t In the examination-in-chief, PW-1 stated that PW-2 witnessed the \\ncommission of rape and murder of the victim. According to the \\nwitness, PW-2 told him that as the door of the room was open while \\nhe was standing outside, he saw the act of commission of rape and \\nmurder. He deposed that after the PW-2 told him about the incident, \\nhe rushed along with two or three other persons to the spot. He \\nfound that the appellant was present there, and he questioned the \\nappellant. Thereafter, the appellant fled. He tried to search for the \\nvictim. He found the dead body of the victim under the haystack \\nin the room. It is pertinent to note that PW-2 had informed PW-1 \\nthat the appellant was the offender. Though two to three persons \\naccompanied PW-1, he did not attempt to apprehend the accused \\nand take him to the police. The conduct of PW-1 of not apprehending \\nthe appellant, though he was present, is unnatural.\\n11.\\t Examination-in-chief of PW-1 was recorded by learned Trial Judge \\non 11th May 2011. At the end of the examination-in-chief, the learned \\nTrial Judge recorded that the case was adjourned at the oral request \\n1\\t\\n[2023] 5 SCR 754 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 609\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n343\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\nof the appellant to engage a counsel. Before the cross-examination \\nwas recorded on 2nd July 2011, an advocate was appointed to espouse \\nthe appellant\\u2019s cause. The cross-examination of PW-1 was recorded \\non 2nd July 2011 and 24th September 2011. The witness reiterated \\nthat he had narrated the facts stated to him by PW-2.\\n12.\\t As far as PW-2 is concerned, he was 10 years old when his \\ndeposition was recorded. Many preliminary questions were put to \\nthe witness by the learned Trial Judge. After satisfying himself that \\nthe witness was able to understand the questions and give a reply \\nto the same, an oath was administered to him. His version in the \\nexamination-in-chief is that the appellant gave drinking water to him \\nand the victim. After drinking the water, when they tried to leave, the \\nappellant caught the victim from behind, took off her undergarments, \\nand the victim started screaming. He did not depose that he had \\nseen the commission of rape and murder by the appellant. To this \\nextent, the version of PW-2, as told to PW-1, is entirely different. \\nPW-1 claims that PW-2 reported to him that he had seen the \\nappellant committing rape and murder from outside the cabin. PW-8, \\nthe investigating officer, stated that he had recorded the Statement \\nof PW-2 on 18th June 2009. Thus, there was a delay of 21 days in \\nrecording his statement, though the FIR recorded that this witness \\nhad seen the appellant committing the crime. There is some dispute \\nabout whether the witness\\u2019s statement recorded under Section 161 \\nof CrPC was produced with the charge sheet. The learned senior \\ncounsel appointed as amicus pointed out that it is not on the record \\nof the Trial Court. In the list of witnesses mentioned in the charge \\nsheet, the name of PW-2 has not been included. Therefore, for \\nall the reasons discussed above, the evidence of PW-2, the only \\neyewitness, cannot be held to be of sterling quality. It is unsafe to \\nbase conviction only on his testimony. Even otherwise, taking his \\ntestimony as correct, the evidence of the PW-2 can, at the highest, \\nbe the evidence of the last seen together.\\n13.\\t Therefore, it is necessary to consider the other circumstantial evidence. \\nIn this case, the recovery of the victim\\u2019s slipper and underwear is \\nalleged at the appellant\\u2019s instance. We have perused the recovery \\nmemo signed by the circle officer and two independent witnesses. The \\nprosecution did not examine the two independent witnesses. Though \\nthe date of recovery is mentioned in the memo, the time and, most \\nimportantly, the place of recovery are not mentioned. Therefore, it \\n344\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncannot be said that pursuant to the statement made by the appellant, \\nin accordance with Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 (for \\nshort, \\u2018the Evidence Act\\u2019), the articles were found at the place stated \\nby the appellant. Hence, the prosecution failed to prove that the \\nrecovery was from a particular place. Thus, evidence of recovery \\nwill have to be kept out of consideration. The recovery of the articles \\nat the instance of the appellant is a very important circumstance in \\nthe chain of circumstances. It is not proved. Hence, the appellant\\u2019s \\nguilt beyond reasonable doubt has not been established.\\nEXAMINATION OF THE APPELLANT UNDER SECTION 313 \\nOF\\u00a0CR.P.C\\n14.\\t Now, we come to the appellant\\u2019s statement, recorded per Section\\u00a0313 \\nof the CrPC. Only three questions were put to the appellant. In \\nthe first question, the names of ten prosecution witnesses were \\nincorporated, and the only question asked to the appellant was what \\nhe had to say about the testimony of ten prosecution witnesses. In \\nthe second question, all the documents produced by the prosecution \\nwere referred, and a question was asked, what the appellant has \\nto say about the documents. In the third question, it was put to the \\nappellant that knowing the fact that the victim belongs to a scheduled \\ncaste, he caused her death after raping her and concealed her dead \\nbody, and he was asked for his reaction to the same. What PW-1 and \\nPW-2 deposed against the appellant was not put to the appellant. The \\ncontents of the incriminating documents were not put to the appellant. \\n15.\\t In the case of Raj Kumar,1 in paragraph 17, this Court has summarised \\nthe law laid down by this Court from time to time on Section 313 of \\nthe CrPC. Paragraph 17 reads thus:\\n\\u201c17. The law consistently laid down by this Court can be \\nsummarized as under:\\n(i)\\t\\nIt is the duty of the Trial Court to put each \\nmaterial circumstance appearing in the evidence \\nagainst the accused specifically, distinctively and \\nseparately. The material circumstance means \\nthe circumstance or the material on the basis of \\nwhich the prosecution is seeking his conviction;\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n345\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\n(ii)\\t\\nThe object of examination of the accused under \\nSection 313 is to enable the accused to explain any \\ncircumstance appearing against him in the evidence;\\n(iii)\\t The Court must ordinarily eschew material \\ncircumstances not put to the accused from \\nconsideration while dealing with the case of the \\nparticular accused;\\n(iv)\\t The failure to put material circumstances to the \\naccused amounts to a serious irregularity. It will \\nvitiate the trial if it is shown to have prejudiced the \\naccused;\\n(v)\\t\\nIf any irregularity in putting the material \\ncircumstance to the accused does not result in \\nfailure of justice, it becomes a curable defect. \\nHowever, while deciding whether the defect can \\nbe cured, one of the considerations will be the \\npassage of time from the date of the incident;\\n(vi)\\t In case such irregularity is curable, even the appellate \\ncourt can question the accused on the material \\ncircumstance which is not put to him; and\\n(vii)\\t In a given case, the case can be remanded to \\nthe Trial Court from the stage of recording the \\nsupplementary statement of the concerned accused \\nunder Section\\u00a0313 of CrPC.\\n(viii)\\t While deciding the question whether prejudice has \\nbeen caused to the accused because of the omission, \\nthe delay in raising the contention is only one of the \\nseveral factors to be considered.\\u201d\\nThis Court based its decision on several decisions, including the \\ndecision in the case of Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of \\nMaharashtra.2 This Court relied upon what was held in paragraph\\u00a016 \\nof the said case. Paragraph 16 of the said case reads thus:\\n2\\t\\n[1974] 1 SCR 489 : (1973) 2 SCC 793\\n346\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n\\u201c16. \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026. It is trite law, nevertheless fundamental, \\nthat the prisoner\\u2019s attention should be drawn to every \\ninculpatory material so as to enable him to explain \\nit. This is the basic fairness of a criminal trial and \\nfailures in this area may gravely imperil the validity of \\nthe trial itself, if consequential miscarriage of justice \\nhas flowed. However, where such an omission has \\noccurred it does not ipso facto vitiate the proceedings \\nand prejudice occasioned by such defect must be \\nestablished by the accused. In the event of evidentiary \\nmaterial not being put to the accused, the court must \\nordinarily eschew such material from consideration. \\nIt is also open to the appellate court to call upon the \\ncounsel for the accused to show what explanation the \\naccused has as regards the circumstances established \\nagainst him but not put to him and if the accused is \\nunable to offer the appellate court any plausible or \\nreasonable explanation of such circumstances, the \\nCourt may assume that no acceptable answer exists \\nand that even if the accused had been questioned at \\nthe proper time in the trial court he would not have \\nbeen able to furnish any good ground to get out of \\nthe circumstances on which the trial court had relied \\nfor its conviction. In such a case, the Court proceeds \\non the footing that though a grave irregularity has \\noccurred as regards compliance with Section 342, \\nCrPC, the omission has not been shown to have caused \\nprejudice to the accused. In the present case, however, \\nthe High Court, though not the trial court has relied upon \\nthe presence of blood on the pants of the blood group of \\nthe deceased. We have not been shown what explanation \\nthe accused could have offered to this chemical finding \\nparticularly when we remember that his answer to the \\nquestion regarding the human blood on the blade of the \\nknife was \\u201cI do not know\\u201d. Counsel for the appellants could \\nnot make out any intelligent explanation and the \\u201cblood\\u201d \\ntestimony takes the crime closer to the accused. However, \\nwe are not inclined to rely over much on this evidentiary \\ncircumstance, although we should emphasise how this \\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n347\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\ninadvertance of the trial court had led to a relevant fact \\nbeing argued as unavailable to the prosecution. Great care \\nis expected of Sessions Judges who try grave cases to \\ncollect every incriminating circumstance and put it to the \\naccused even though at the end of a long trial the Judge \\nmay be a little fagged out.\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\nIn a given case, the witnesses may have deposed in a language not \\nknown to the accused. In such a case, if the material circumstances \\nappearing in evidence are not put to the accused and explained to \\nthe accused, in a language understood by him, it will cause prejudice \\nto the accused. \\n16.\\t In the present case, there is no doubt that material circumstances \\nappearing in evidence against the appellant have not been put to \\nhim. The version of the main prosecution witnesses PWs-1 and\\u00a02 was \\nnot put to him. The stage of the accused leading defence evidence \\narises only after his statement is recorded under Section 313 of \\nthe CrPC. Unless all material circumstances appearing against him \\nin evidence are put to the accused, he cannot decide whether he \\nwants to lead any defence evidence. In this case, even the date \\nand place of the crime allegedly committed by the appellant were \\nnot put to the appellant. What was reportedly seen by PW-2 was \\nnot put to the appellant in his examination. Therefore, the appellant \\nwas prejudiced. Even assuming that failure to put material to the \\nappellant in his examination is an irregularity, the question is whether \\nit can be cured by remanding the case to the Trial Court. \\n17.\\t The date of occurrence is of 27th May 2009. Thus, the incident is \\nfifteen and a half years old. After such a long gap of fifteen and \\nhalf years, it will be unjust if the appellant is now told to explain \\nthe circumstances and material specifically appearing against him \\nin the evidence. Moreover, the appellant had been incarcerated \\nfor about twelve years and nine months before he was released \\non bail. Therefore, considering the long passage of time, there is \\nno option but to hold that the defect cannot be cured at this stage. \\nEven assuming that the evidence of PW-2 can be believed, the \\nappellant is entitled to acquittal on the ground of the failure to put \\nincriminating material to him in his examination under Section 313 \\nof the CrPC. We are surprised to note that both the Trial Court and \\n348\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nHigh Court have overlooked non-compliance with the requirements \\nof Section 313 of the CrPC. Shockingly, the Trial Court imposed the \\ndeath penalty in a case which ought to have resulted in acquittal. \\nImposing capital punishment in such a case shocks the conscience \\nof this Court. \\nROLE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\\n18.\\t Under sub-Section (5) of Section 313 of CrPC (sub-Section (5) of \\nSection 351 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023), the Court \\nis entitled to secure the assistance of the public prosecutor and the \\nadvocate representing the accused to prepare the questions to be \\nput in the examination under Section 313. A Public Prosecutor has \\nto play an active role in ensuring that every trial is conducted in a \\nfair manner and in accordance with the law. Hence, it is the Public \\nProsecutor\\u2019s duty to invite the Court\\u2019s attention to the requirement \\nof putting all incriminating material to the accused. Therefore, the \\nPublic Prosecutor is under an obligation to remain present when the \\nexamination of the accused is made to assist the Court. \\nFAILURE TO PROVIDE LEGAL AID TO THE ACCUSED\\n19.\\t After having perused the record of the case, we found a very disturbing \\nfeature. It is about the failure of the State to provide timely legal aid \\nto the appellant. The other issue is about the quality of legal aid. \\nApart from provisions of Article 21 and Article 39A of the Constitution \\nof India, the law on the issue of the right to legal aid has been \\nevolved by this Court through its landmark decisions. This Court\\u2019s first \\nwell-known decision is in the case of Hussainara Khatoon (IV) v. \\nHome Secy., State of Bihar.3 In Paragraph 7, this Court held thus:\\n\\u201c7. We may also refer to Article 39-A the fundamental \\nconstitutional directive which reads as follows:\\n\\u201c39-A. Equal justice and free legal aid.\\u2014The State \\nshall secure that the operation of the legal system \\npromotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, \\nand shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by \\nsuitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, \\nto ensure that opportunities for securing justice are \\n3\\t\\n[1979] 3 SCR 1276 : (1980) 1 SCC 98\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n349\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\nnot denied to any citizen by reason of economic or \\nother disabilities.\\u201d \\n(emphasis added)\\nThis article also emphasises that free legal service is \\nan unalienable element of \\u201creasonable, fair and just\\u201d \\nprocedure for without it a person suffering from economic \\nor other disabilities would be deprived of the opportunity \\nfor securing justice. The right to free legal services \\nis, therefore, clearly an essential ingredient of \\n\\u201creasonable, fair and just\\u201d, procedure for a person \\naccused of an offence and it must be held implicit in \\nthe guarantee of Article 21. This is a constitutional \\nright of every accused person who is unable to engage \\na lawyer and secure legal services on account of \\nreasons such as poverty, indigence or incommunicado \\nsituation and the State is under a mandate to provide \\na lawyer to an accused person if the circumstances of \\nthe case and the needs of justice so require, provided \\nof course the accused person does not object to the \\nprovision of such lawyer. We would, therefore, direct that \\non the next remand dates, when the undertrial prisoners, \\ncharged with bailable offences, are produced before the \\nMagistrates, the State Government should provide them \\na lawyer at its own cost for the purpose of making an \\napplication for bail, provided that no objection is raised \\nto such lawyer on behalf of such undertrial prisoners and \\nif any application for bail is made, the Magistrates should \\ndispose of the same in accordance with the broad outlines \\nset out by us in our judgment dated February 12, 1979. \\nThe State Government will report to the High Court of \\nPatna its compliance with this direction within a period \\nof six weeks from today.\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\nThe second decision is in the case of M.H. Hoskot v. State of \\nMaharashtra.4 In paragraphs 14 and 25 of the decision, this Court \\nheld thus:\\n4\\t\\n[1979] 1 SCR 192 : (1978) 3 SCC 544\\n350\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n\\u201c14. The other ingredient of fair procedure to a prisoner, \\nwho has to seek his liberation through the court \\nprocess is lawyer\\u2019s services. Judicial justice, with \\nprocedural intricacies, legal submissions and critical \\nexamination of evidence, leans upon professional \\nexpertise; and a failure of equal justice under the law \\nis on the cards where such supportive skill is absent \\nfor one side. Our judicature, moulded by Anglo-American \\nmodels and our judicial process, engineered by kindred \\nlegal technology, compel the collaboration of lawyer-power \\nfor steering the wheels of equal justice under the law. Free \\nlegal services to the needy is part of the English criminal \\njustice system. And the American jurist, Prof. Vance of \\nYale, sounded sense for India too when he said: [ Justice \\nand Reform, Earl Johnson, Jr. p. 11]\\n\\u201cWhat does it profit a poor and ignorant man that he is \\nequal to his strong antagonist before the law if there is no \\none to inform him what the law is? Or that the courts are \\nopen to him on the same terms as to all other persons when \\nhe has not the wherewithal to pay the admission fee?\\u201d \\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\n\\u201c25. If a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment, is virtually \\nunable to exercise his constitutional and statutory right of \\nappeal, inclusive of special leave to appeal, for want of legal \\nassistance, there is implicit in the Court under Article 142, \\nread with Articles 21 and 39-A of the Constitution, power \\nto assign counsel for such imprisoned individual \\u201cfor doing \\ncomplete justice\\u201d. This is a necessary incident of the right \\nof appeal conferred by the Code and allowed by Article 136 \\nof the Constitution. The inference is inevitable that this \\nis a State\\u2019s duty and not Government\\u2019s charity. Equally \\naffirmative is the implication that while legal services \\nmust be free to the beneficiary, the lawyer himself has \\nto be reasonably remunerated for his services. Surely, \\nthe profession has a public commitment to the people but \\nmere philanthropy of its members yields short mileage in \\nthe long run. Their services, especially when they are on \\nbehalf of the State must be paid for. Naturally, the State \\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n351\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\nconcerned must pay a reasonable sum that the court may \\nfix when assigning counsel to the prisoner. Of course, \\nthe court may judge the situation and consider from all \\nangles whether it is necessary for the ends of justice to \\nmake available legal aid in the particular case. In every \\ncountry where free legal services are given it is not done \\nin all cases but only where public justice suffers otherwise. \\nThat discretion resides in the court.\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\nThis issue was again dealt with by a Bench of three Judges in the \\ncase of Anokhilal v. State of M.P..5 In this decision, this Court \\nrevisited the law on this aspect. In paragraph 11, this Court relied \\nupon the decision in the case of Hussainara Khatoon (IV).3 In \\nparagraph 20, this Court summarised the principles laid down from \\ntime to time. Paragraph 20 reads thus:\\n\\u201c20. The following principles, therefore, emerge from the \\ndecisions referred to hereinabove:\\n20.1. Article 39-A inserted by the 42nd Amendment to the \\nConstitution, effected in the year 1977, provides for free \\nlegal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are \\nnot denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other \\ndisabilities. The statutory regime put in place including the \\nenactment of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 is \\ndesigned to achieve the mandate of Article 39-A.\\n20.2. It has been well accepted that right to free legal \\nservices is an essential ingredient of \\u201creasonable, fair \\nand just\\u201d procedure for a person accused of an offence \\nand it must be held implicit in the right guaranteed \\nby Article 21. The extract from the decision of this \\nCourt in Best Bakery case [Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh \\nv. State of Gujarat (2004) 4 SCC 158 : 2004 SCC (Cri) \\n999] (as quoted in the decision in Mohd. Hussain \\n[Mohd. Hussain v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2012) 9 SCC \\n408 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 1139] ) emphasises that the \\nobject of criminal trial is to search for the truth and \\n5\\t\\n[2019] 18 SCR 1196 : (2019) 20 SCC 196\\n352\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe trial is not a bout over technicalities and must be \\nconducted in such manner as will protect the innocent \\nand punish the guilty.\\n20.3. Even before insertion of Article 39-A in the Constitution, \\nthe decision of this Court in Bashira [Bashira v. State of \\nU.P. (1969) 1 SCR 32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ \\n1495] put the matter beyond any doubt and held that the \\ntime granted to the Amicus Curiae in that matter to prepare \\nfor the defence was completely insufficient and that the \\naward of sentence of death resulted in deprivation of the \\nlife of the accused and was in breach of the procedure \\nestablished by law.\\n20.4. The portion quoted in Bashira [Bashira v. State of \\nU.P. (1969) 1 SCR 32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri \\nLJ 1495] from the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High \\nCourt authored [Alla Nageswara Rao, In re, 1954 SCC \\nOnLine AP 115 : AIR 1957 AP 505] by Subba Rao, J., the \\nthen Chief Justice of the High Court, stated with clarity \\nthat mere formal compliance of the rule under which \\nsufficient time had to be given to the counsel to prepare \\nfor the defence would not carry out the object underlying \\nthe rule. It was further stated that the opportunity must be \\nreal where the counsel is given sufficient and adequate \\ntime to prepare.\\n20.5. In Bashira [Bashira v. State of U.P. (1969) 1 SCR \\n32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ 1495] as well \\nas in Ambadas [Ambadas Laxman Shinde v. State of \\nMaharashtra (2018) 18 SCC 788 : (2019) 3 SCC (Cri) \\n452 : (2018) 14 Scale 730], making substantial progress \\nin the matter on the very day after a counsel was engaged \\nas Amicus Curiae, was not accepted by this Court as \\ncompliance with \\u201csufficient opportunity\\u201d to the counsel.\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\nIn paragraph 31, norms were laid down by this Court, which read thus:\\n\\u201c31. Before we part, we must lay down certain norms so \\nthat the infirmities that we have noticed in the present \\nmatter are not repeated:\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n353\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\n31.1. In all cases where there is a possibility of life \\nsentence or death sentence, learned advocates who \\nhave put in minimum of 10 years\\u2019 practice at the Bar \\nalone be considered to be appointed as Amicus Curiae \\nor through legal services to represent an accused.\\n31.2. In all matters dealt with by the High Court concerning \\nconfirmation of death sentence, Senior Advocates of the \\nCourt must first be considered to be appointed as Amicus \\nCuriae.\\n31.3. Whenever any learned counsel is appointed as \\nAmicus Curiae, some reasonable time may be provided to \\nenable the counsel to prepare the matter. There cannot be \\nany hard-and-fast rule in that behalf. However, a minimum \\nof seven days' time may normally be considered to be \\nappropriate and adequate.\\n31.4. Any learned counsel, who is appointed as Amicus \\nCuriae on behalf of the accused must normally be granted \\nto have meetings and discussion with the accused \\nconcerned. Such interactions may prove to be helpful as \\nwas noticed in Imtiyaz Ramzan Khan [Imtiyaz Ramzan \\nKhan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) 9 SCC 160 : (2018) \\n3 SCC (Cri) 721] .\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\n20.\\t Thus, the right to get legal aid is a fundamental right of the accused, \\nguaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Even under Section \\n303 of the CrPC, every accused has a right to be defended by a \\npleader of his choice. Section 304 provides for the grant of legal \\naid to an accused free of costs. When an accused has either not \\nengaged an advocate or does not have sufficient means to engage \\nan advocate, it is the trial court\\u2019s duty to inform the accused \\nof his right to obtain free legal aid, which is a right covered by Article \\n21 of the Constitution of India. Sub-Section (1)of Section 304 reads \\nthus:\\n\\u201c304. Legal aid to accused at State expense in certain \\ncases.\\u2014(1) Where, in a trial before the Court of Session, \\nthe accused is not represented by a pleader, and \\nwhere it appears to the Court that the accused has \\n354\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nnot sufficient means to engage a pleader, the Court \\nshall assign a pleader for his defence at the expense \\nof the State.\\n(2) \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026..\\n(3) \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026..\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u201d\\n(emphasis added)\\nSections 340 and 341 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, \\n2023 (for short, \\u2018BNSS\\u2019) are the Sections which correspond to \\nSections 303 and 304 of the CrPC. Thus, under Section 304 of the \\nCrPC, it is the duty of the Court to ensure that a legal aid lawyer is \\nappointed to espouse the cause of the accused.\\n21.\\t Now, we come back to the facts of the case. From the proceedings \\nof the Trial Court, it appears that when the charges were framed \\non 8th September 2010, and when the plea was recorded, the \\nappellant was not represented by any advocate. Proceedings of 26th \\nFebruary 2011 record that though three witnesses of the prosecution \\nwere present, the appellant was not represented by any advocate. \\nTherefore, assurance of the appellant has been recorded that he \\nwould call his counsel on the next date. On 11th May 2011, the \\nexamination-in-chief of PW-1 was recorded. In the proceedings, the \\ncourt recorded that the appellant had not engaged any advocate on \\nthat day, and he was not desirous of taking legal aid. However, on \\n8th June 2011, an advocate was appointed to espouse his cause. \\nWe find that on 20th July 2012, 4th October 2012, 1st November \\n2012, 7th November 2012, 9th November 2012 and 23rd November \\n2012, the advocate appointed as amicus curiae for the appellant \\nwas absent. Applications were required to be made by him to \\nrecall certain witnesses as the cross-examination was closed due \\nto his absence. Thus, the evidence of more than one prosecution \\nwitness was recorded in the absence of the legal aid advocate. On \\n7th November 2012, another advocate was appointed to espouse \\nthe appellant\\u2019s cause. We find that a third advocate conducted the \\ncross-examination of PW-8. \\n22.\\t At the stage of framing the charge, the appellant was not represented \\nby an advocate. From 8th June 2011, the appellant never declined \\nlegal aid. We are surprised to note that the examination-in-chief of \\nPW-1 was allowed to be recorded without giving legal aid counsel \\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n355\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\nto the appellant, who was not represented by an advocate. If the \\nexamination-in-chief of a prosecution witness is recorded in the \\nabsence of the advocate for the accused, a very valuable right of \\nobjecting to the questions asked in examination-in-chief is taken \\naway. The accused is also deprived of the right to object to leading \\nquestions. It will not be appropriate to comment on the capabilities \\nof the two legal aid lawyers appointed in this case as they are not \\nparties before us. But suffice it to say that the cross-examination of \\nthe witnesses was not up to the mark. Some of the crucial questions \\nthat normally would have been put in the cross-examination have \\nnot been asked. \\nCONCLUDING PART\\n23.\\t Our conclusions and directions regarding the role of the Public \\nProsecutor and appointment of legal aid lawyers are as follows:\\na.\\t\\nIt is the duty of the Court to ensure that proper legal aid is \\nprovided to an accused;\\nb.\\t\\nWhen an accused is not represented by an advocate, it is the \\nduty of every Public Prosecutor to point out to the Court the \\nrequirement of providing him free legal aid. The reason is that \\nit is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to ensure that the trial is \\nconducted fairly and lawfully;\\nc.\\t\\nEven if the Court is inclined to frame charges or record \\nexamination-in-chief of the prosecution witnesses in a case \\nwhere the accused has not engaged any advocate, it is \\nincumbent upon the Public Prosecutor to request the Court not \\nto proceed without offering legal aid to the accused;\\nd.\\t\\nIt is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to assist the Trial Court \\nin recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of \\nthe CrPC. If the Court omits to put any material circumstance \\nbrought on record against the accused, the Public Prosecutor \\nmust bring it to the notice of the Court while the examination \\nof the accused is being recorded. He must assist the Court in \\nframing the questions to be put to the accused. As it is the duty \\nof the Public Prosecutor to ensure that those who are guilty of \\nthe commission of offence must be punished, it is also his duty \\nto ensure that there are no infirmities in the conduct of the trial \\nwhich will cause prejudice to the accused;\\n356\\b\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ne.\\t\\nAn accused who is not represented by an advocate is entitled to \\nfree legal aid at all material stages starting from remand. Every \\naccused has the right to get legal aid, even to file bail petitions;\\nf.\\t\\nAt all material stages, including the stage of framing the \\ncharge, recording the evidence, etc., it is the duty of the Court \\nto make the accused aware of his right to get free legal aid. \\nIf the accused expresses that he needs legal aid, the Trial \\nCourt must ensure that a legal aid advocate is appointed to \\nrepresent the accused;\\ng.\\t\\nAs held in the case of Anokhilal,5 in all the cases where there \\nis a possibility of a life sentence or death sentence, only those \\nlearned advocates who have put in a minimum of ten years \\nof practice on the criminal side should be considered to be \\nappointed as amicus curiae or as a legal aid advocate. Even \\nin the cases not covered by the categories mentioned above, \\nthe accused is entitled to a legal aid advocate who has good \\nknowledge of the law and has an experience of conducting \\ntrials on the criminal side. It would be ideal if the Legal Services \\nAuthorities at all levels give proper training to the newly appointed \\nlegal aid advocates not only by conducting lectures but also \\nby allowing the newly appointed legal aid advocates to work \\nwith senior members of the Bar in a requisite number of trials;\\nh.\\t\\nThe State Legal Services Authorities shall issue directions to \\nthe Legal Services Authorities at all levels to monitor the work \\nof the legal aid advocate and shall ensure that the legal aid \\nadvocates attend the court regularly and punctually when the \\ncases entrusted to them are fixed;\\ni.\\t\\nIt is necessary to ensure that the same legal aid advocate \\nis continued throughout the trial unless there are compelling \\nreasons to do so or unless the accused appoints an advocate \\nof his choice;\\nj.\\t\\nIn the cases where the offences are of a very serious nature \\nand complicated legal and factual issues are involved, the Court, \\ninstead of appointing an empanelled legal aid advocate, may \\nappoint a senior member of the Bar who has a vast experience \\nof conducting trials to espouse the cause of the accused so \\nthat the accused gets best possible legal assistance;\\n[2024] 12 S.C.R. \\b\\n357\\nAshok v. State of Uttar Pradesh\\nk.\\t\\nThe right of the accused to defend himself in a criminal trial \\nis guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. He \\nis entitled to a fair trial. But if effective legal aid is not made \\navailable to an accused who is unable to engage an advocate, it \\nwill amount to infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed \\nby Article 21;\\nl.\\t\\nIf legal aid is provided only for the sake of providing it, it will \\nserve no purpose. Legal aid must be effective. Advocates \\nappointed to espouse the cause of the accused must have good \\nknowledge of criminal laws, law of evidence and procedural laws \\napart from other important statutes. As there is a constitutional \\nright to legal aid, that right will be effective only if the legal aid \\nprovided is of a good quality. If the legal aid advocate provided \\nto an accused is not competent enough to conduct the trial \\nefficiently, the rights of the accused will be violated. \\n24.\\t For the reasons recorded earlier, the appeal is allowed. The impugned \\njudgments and orders are set aside, and the appellant is acquitted \\nof offences alleged against him. The bail bonds of the appellant \\nstand cancelled.\\n25.\\t A copy of this judgment shall be forwarded to all State Legal Services \\nAuthorities to enable the authorities to take necessary measures.\\n26.\\t We record our appreciation for the able assistance rendered to the \\nCourt by the learned senior counsel Shri M.Shoeb Alam, appointed \\nto espouse the cause of the appellant. We must also record that \\nthe learned senior counsel, Shri K.Parameshwar, appearing for the \\nrespondent, has fairly assisted the Court.\\nResult of the case: Appeal allowed.\\n\\u2020Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain\",\n          \"Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court\\nJudgment\\nPamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.\\n1.\\t\\nThis criminal appeal by appellants (accused 1 to 4) is against the \\nconcurrent conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 and \\nsentence for life imposed by the Trial as well as the Telangana High \\nCourt. For the reasons to follow, while we confirm the judgment and \\nsentence with respect to A-1, A-2 and A-4, the conviction and sentence \\nof A-3 is however modified to Section 304 Part II and sentenced to \\n10 years imprisonment. The details of the crime, trial, decisions of \\nthe Courts, followed by our analyses and conclusions are as follows.\\n2.\\t\\nThe case of the prosecution is that the accused 1 to 4 belonging to \\nthe same family, and the deceased, come from the same village - \\nJanda Venkatpur, Asifabad, Telangana. It is alleged that the sister of \\nthe deceased and the wife of A-4 were political aspirants and they \\ncontested the Gram Panchayat elections. In the said elections, the \\nsister of the deceased succeeded and the wife of A-4 lost and that, \\nunfortunately, led to an animosity between the two groups, eventually \\nleading to the murder of the deceased which is described as follows.\\n3.\\t\\nOn 15.11.2001, at about 8AM, the deceased was going to Luxettipet \\non some work in an auto-rikshaw. In the same auto-rikshaw, one \\nSanga Swamy @ Thruputhi (PW-6) and Smt. Chetimala Rajitha \\n(PW-9) were travelling as co-passengers. When the auto reached \\nthe house of A-4, it is alleged that A-1 stopped the auto-rickshaw \\nand dragged the deceased out by pulling his legs. At the same time, \\nA-2 joined A-1 and both the accused dragged the deceased towards \\nthe house of A-4. At that point, it is alleged that A-1 to A-4 attacked \\nthe deceased with an axe, a sword, a stone and a knife, thereby \\ninflicting severe bleeding injuries leading to death of the deceased \\non the spot. \\n4.\\t\\nThe son of the deceased, Kona Kiran Kumar, later examined as \\nPW-1, being an eyewitness, proceeded to the police station and \\nreported the incident at about 9PM by way of a complaint (Exhibit \\n4\\b\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nP-1).\\tThe Sub-Inspector of Police (PW-17), Luxettipet received the \\ncomplaint and registered an FIR (Exhibit P-32), and took up the \\ninvestigation. He then recorded the statement of PW-1. \\n5.\\t\\nIn view of the gravity of the crime, the Circle Inspector of \\nPolice (PW-18) took up further investigation and immediately \\nproceeded to the village to examine the scene of offence. He \\nfound the body of the deceased in the front yard of A-4\\u2019s house. \\nHe enabled PW-15 to take photographs of the dead body \\n(Exhibits P-21 to 30) and himself drew the sketch of the scene \\nof offence (Exhibit P-37). He also conducted an inquest over \\nthe body of the deceased in the presence of PW-10 and \\nPW-12 (panch witnesses). The inquest report was marked as Exhibit \\nP-5. He also seized a stick (MO.4), control earth (MO.5), blood-\\nstained earth (MO.6), cotton full shirt (MO.7) and a baniyan under \\ncover of a panchnama. PW-18 recorded the statements of PWs 4, \\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 15. The prosecution maintained that PWs 1, 3, 4, \\n6, 7 and 8 are eyewitnesses to the incident. \\n6.\\t\\nThe Judicial Magistrate First-Class (PW-16) also recorded the \\nstatements of PWs 1 to 9 under Section 164 of the CrPC. The Post-\\nmortem over the dead body of the deceased was conducted by Dr \\nVictor Dinesh (PW-11) at 3PM on 15.11.2001 at the Government \\nCivil Hospital. PW-11, in his report, found 8 incised wounds, 3 partial \\namputations and 1 deep lacerated wound. It was his opinion that the \\ncause of death was due to cardio-pulmonary arrest due to transaction \\nspinal cord at atlanto occipital joint.\\n7.\\t\\nThe Sub-Inspector (PW-17) is said to have apprehended all the \\naccused on 23.11.2001 and produced them before PW-18 in his \\noffice. PW-18 recorded the confessional statement of the accused in \\nthe presence of PW-13 and PW-14 (panch witnesses). In pursuance \\nof the confession, all the accused led him and the panch witnesses \\nto the field of one Mr. Appani Gangaiah at Laximpur Shivar. There, \\nA-1 recovered and showed an axe, A-2 a sword and A-4 a knife \\nwhich were all hidden behind the bushes in the field. PW-18 seized \\nthese objects in front of PW-11 to PW-13, later came to be marked \\nas Exhibits MOs 1 to 3. PW-18 also recovered a lungi belonging to \\nA-1 and one belonging to A-2 (Exhibit MO\\u2019s 9 and 10, respectively). \\nThese material objects were sent to a Forensic Lab in Hyderabad, \\nthe report of which is marked as Exhibit P-16.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R. \\b\\n5\\nVelthepu Srinivas and Others v. \\nState of Andhra Pradesh (Now State of Telangana) and Anr.\\n8.\\t\\nAfter completion of the above referred investigation, a charge-\\nsheet was filed on 09.01.2002. The Judicial First-Class Magistrate, \\nLuxettipet took cognizance of the offence under Section 302 read \\nwith Section 34 of IPC, against all the accused. On production of the \\naccused, the Magistrate furnished copies of the charge-sheet and \\nother connected documents and committed the case to the Court \\nof Sessions and the Learned Sessions Judge numbered the trial as \\nSessions Case No. 523 of 2003. After the charges were framed, the \\naccused pleaded not guilty and sought trial. \\n9.\\t\\nAt the trial, the prosecution examined 18 witnesses being PW-1 to \\nPW-18, and marked 37 documents and 10 Material Objects (MO\\u2019s). \\nAfter the closure of evidence, the accused were examined under \\nSection 313 CrPC with reference to the incriminating material found \\nagainst them in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, and they \\ndenied the same. There are no defence witnesses. \\n10.\\t The Trial Court, by its elaborate judgment dated 24.02.2005, found \\nall four accused guilty for the murder of the deceased and convicted \\nthem under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. Accordingly, \\nthey were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a \\nfine of Rs. 500 each, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment of \\none month. All the accused appealed to the High Court. \\n11.\\t For the completeness of narration, we may indicate that the High Court \\ninitially acquitted all the accused by its judgment dated 21.06.2007, \\nbut in appeal to this Court, their conviction and sentences were \\nset-aside, and the criminal appeal was remanded back to the High \\nCourt for fresh consideration. It is in this background that the order \\nimpugned came to be passed by the High Court. \\n12.\\t After remand, the High Court confirmed the judgment of the Trial \\nCourt and dismissed the criminal appeals. The Special Leave Petition \\nfiled by the accused was admitted on 01.08.2022 and this is how we \\nhave heard Shri Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellants \\nand Shri Krishan Kumar Singh learned counsel for the State and \\nShri Sirajudeen, learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 2. \\n13.\\t Findings of the Trial Court: The Trial Court had examined the \\ncredibility of the Prosecution witness in great detail. According to \\nthe Trial Court, PWs 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 were eyewitnesses to the \\nincident and their testimonies were consistent. Among them, PW-6\\u2019s \\n6\\b\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ntestimony was a clinching piece of evidence as he was privy to the \\nincident from the very beginning. He was subjected to intense cross-\\nexamination with respect to his residence and other details about \\nthe incident. Except for minor variations, the Trial Court found his \\ntestimony unshaken, being consistent and natural. The Trial Court \\nfound the testimonies PW-1, PW-3, PW-4, PW-7, PW-8 corroborating \\nthe incident of stopping an auto, dragging the deceased out, and \\nsubsequently assaulting the deceased with various weapons. \\n14.\\t Collectively, the witnesses reiterated that A-1 stopped the auto-\\nrickshaw and pulled the deceased out and A-2 attacking the \\ndeceased\\u2019s hands with a sword. As they reached A-4\\u2019s house, A-4 \\ntook the sword from A-2 and struck the deceased on his head. A-4 \\nalso inflicted injuries by a knife. The common account about A-3 is \\nthat he hit the deceased on the head with a stone. Accused No. 1 \\ncontinued the attack and hit the deceased with an axe. Largely, these \\nwitnesses recounted a consistent narrative of the attack, identifying \\nthe weapons used and the roles of each accused. \\n15.\\t Judgment of the High Court: According to the High Court, the \\naccounts of PWs 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, who witnessed the incident, \\nconverge and are consistent with the injuries, weapons and motive \\nfor the murder of the deceased. The High Court correctly relied on \\nthe evidence of PW-6 who was in an auto-rickshaw along with the \\ndeceased on the day of the incident. PW6\\u2019s evidence that he boarded \\nthe auto-rickshaw of PW-5, followed by the deceased and Rajitha \\n(PW-9) joining him, was believed by the High Court. \\n16.\\t The account of PW6 being corroborated by the evidence of PWs \\n1, 3, 4, 7 and 8, the High Court held that the evidence conclusively \\nestablishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The \\nHigh Court also noted the submission relating to the contradictions \\nin the Complaint (Ex. P1) and the testimonies of PWs 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 \\nand 8, specifically relating to the acts of assault, however, the High \\nCourt came to the conclusion that they were minor in nature. \\n17.\\t Though the High Court saw that the trial court extensively examined \\nthe evidence and considered all the submissions, it has nevertheless \\nconsidered the evidence afresh and after a detailed examination, \\narrived at the same conclusion. We have given our anxious \\nconsideration and have scrutinised the evidence of all the eye-\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R. \\b\\n7\\nVelthepu Srinivas and Others v. \\nState of Andhra Pradesh (Now State of Telangana) and Anr.\\nwitnesses in detail. We are in full agreement with the decision of the \\nTrial Court and the High Court. Their analyses and conclusions are \\nbased on correct appreciation of evidence and law. However, there \\nis one aspect which stands out in the above-referred analyses of the \\nTrial Court and the High Court, and that pertains to the conclusion on \\nthe culpability of A-3 for murder. We will now examine the evidence \\nas against A-3. \\n18.\\t Evidence against Accused No.3: To commence with, the FIR states \\nthat A-3 hit the deceased on the head, thereby causing death. The \\nChargesheet states that A3 used a stone to do the same. However, \\nno further details have been provided. Further as we examine the \\ntestimonies of all the eyewitnesses the following picture emerges. \\nPWs 1, 3, 4 and 6 state that the A-3 had used a stone to hit the \\ndeceased\\u2019s head. PW-7 and PW-8 do not speak about his role. \\n19.\\t PW-1, in his examination-in-chief and cross-examination, has \\nrespectively stated as follows: \\nChief - \\u201cWhen I was trying to go near the deceased, A-3 \\nthreatened me saying that if I go there he would kill me. \\nA-3 hit the deceased with a stone.\\u201d\\nCross - \\u201cI read Ex. P-1 complaint and it does not show \\nthat A-1 and A-3 threatened me and other eye witnesses \\nto kill if we tried to rescue the deceased\\u201d\\n20.\\t PW-3, in his examination-in-chief and cross-examination, has \\nrespectively stated as follows: \\nChief - \\u201cAfter hearing the cries of the said Rajitha and \\nSwamy I, PW1, Kona Mallesh Akireeddy Ramesh, T.Odaiah \\nrushed to the spot. By the time we reached the spot the \\ndeceased was lying on ground with injuries and on seeing \\nus A-3 took a stone and gave threats to us saying that he \\nwould hit us if we go there.\\u201d\\nCross - \\u201cIt is not true to say that I did not state before the \\npolice that when land other eye witnesses were going \\nnear\\u00b7 the place of the incident A-3 armed with a stone \\nthreatened to kill us. It is not true to say that for the first \\ntime before this court I am deposing that A-3 armed with \\na stone threatened me and other witnesses to kill\\u201d\\n8\\b\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n21.\\t P.W. 4, in his examination-in-chief, has stated as follows: \\n\\u201cA-3 took a stone and hit on the head of the deceased.\\u201d\\n22.\\t P.W. 6, in his examination-in-chief, has stated as follows:\\n\\u201cA-3 took a stone and hit on the head of the deceased.\\u201d\\n23.\\t A reading of the judgment and order passed by the Trial as well as \\nthe High Court would indicate that neither the prosecution or defence, \\nnor the court, have focussed on the role of A-3 as evidenced by \\nthe oral and documentary evidence. There is nothing to attribute \\nA-3 with the intent to murder the deceased. In fact, both the Courts \\nhave mechanically drawn an inference against A-3 under Section 34 \\nof the Act merely based on his presence near the scene of offence \\nand his familial relations with the other accused. \\n24.\\t As per the post-mortem report, the cause of death is \\u201ccardio \\npulmonary arrest due to transaction spinal cord at atlanto occipital \\njoint\\u201d. The atlanto occipital joint is at the back of the neck, which is \\nthe exact place where A-1 assaulted the deceased with the help of \\nan axe. This axe was then taken by A-2 and thereafter, by A-4, who \\nalso assaulted the deceased. All the eye-witnesses are clear in this \\naccount. In other words, it was only A-3 who never took the axe in \\nhis hand. He only used a stone to assault the deceased. \\n25.\\t Considering the statements of the eye-witnesses, coupled with the \\npost-mortem report, it is not possible to contend that A-3 would have \\nhad the intention to commit the murder of the deceased and as such, \\nhe cannot be convicted under Section 302 IPC.\\n26.\\t In fact, Victor Dinesh (PW-11), who gave the post-mortem report \\nhad indicated the injuries as under:\\n\\u201c1.\\t\\nIncised wound extending from right ear to left cheek \\n19 cm long 6 cm deep 2 mm wide grievous sharp \\nweapon, Ante mortem.\\n2.\\t\\nIncised wound on the right eye brow (4cms) simple \\nsharp weapon Ante mortem.\\n3.\\t\\nIncised wound on the left side of fore head about \\n9 cms above left eye brow measuring 8 cms sharp \\nweapon Ante mortem.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R. \\b\\n9\\nVelthepu Srinivas and Others v. \\nState of Andhra Pradesh (Now State of Telangana) and Anr.\\n4.\\t\\nIncised wound on left shoulder measuring 4 cm long \\n3mm wide. Sharp weapon ante mortem.\\n5.\\t\\nIncised wound on right should of 8 cm long 1 \\u00bd cm \\nwide sharp weapon, ante mortem.\\n6.\\t\\n5 cm x 6 Incised wound (slice) on the vertex. Sharp \\nweapon ante mortem.\\n7.\\t\\n8 cms long incised wound backs of left wrist, sharp \\nweapon ante mortem.\\n8.\\t\\n12 cms incised wound on the front of left hand, sharp \\nweapon, ante mortem.\\n9.\\t\\nPartial amputation of middle 3 fingers of left hand, \\nante mortem.\\n10.\\t Partial amputation of right thumb. Measuring 2 cms \\nsharp weapon ante mortem.\\n11.\\t Partial amputation of right index finger measuring 3 \\ncms sharp weapon, ante mortem.\\n12.\\t Deep lacerated wound on the back of neck measuring \\n18 cms 7 cms with complete transaction of spinal \\ncard and Atlanta occipital joint. Blunt weapon, ante \\nmortem.\\u201d\\n27.\\t It is evident from the evidence of PW-11 that the deceased suffered \\n12 injuries, of which 10 are caused by sharp-edged weapons. The \\n11th injury is a partial amputation of the middle 3 fingers of left hand. \\nThe final injury is a lacerated wound on the back of neck measuring \\n18 cms x 7 cms with complete transaction of spinal cord and atlanto \\noccipital joint. The Trial Court and the High Court have not analysed \\nthe evidence as against A-3. They have proceeded to convict him \\nalong with others under Section 302 with the aid of Section 34. The \\ncumulative circumstances in which A-3 was seen participating in \\nthe crime would clearly indicate that he had no intention to commit \\nmurder of the deceased for two clear reasons. Firstly, while every \\nother accused took the axe used by A1 initially and contributed to the \\nassault with this weapon, A-3 did not wield the axe at any point of \\ntime. Secondly, A-3 only had a stone in his hand, and in fact, some \\nof the witnesses said that he merely threatened in case they seek \\n10\\b\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto intervene and prevent the assault. Under these circumstances, \\nwe hold that A-3 did not share a common intention to commit the \\nmurder of the deceased. Additionally, there is no evidence that A-3 \\ncame along with the other accused evidencing a common intention. \\nThe description of the incident is that when the deceased came to \\nthe scene of occurrence, A-1 dragged him to the house of A-4, and \\nthe other accused joined A-1. In this context, A-3 picked up a stone \\nto assault the deceased.\\n28.\\t Even though, A-3 might not have had the common intention to \\ncommit the murder, nevertheless, his participation in the assault \\nand the wielding of the stone certainly makes him culpable for the \\noffence that he has committed. While we acquit A-3 of the offence \\nunder Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, he is liable for \\nthe offence under 304 Part II IPC. The law on Section 304 Part II \\nhas been succinctly laid down in Camilo Vaz v. State of Goa, (2000) \\n9 SCC 1, where it was held that:\\n14.\\u00a0This section is in two parts. If analysed, the section \\nprovides for two kinds of punishment to two different \\nsituations: (1) if the act by which death is caused is \\ndone\\u00a0with the intention of causing death\\u00a0or causing such \\nbodily injury as is likely to cause death. Here the important \\ningredient is the \\u201cintention\\u201d; (2) if the act is done with the \\nknowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any \\nintention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely \\nto cause death. When a person hits another with a danda \\non a vital part of the body with such force that the person \\nhit meets his death, knowledge has to be imputed to the \\naccused\\u2026.\\n29.\\t In the past, this Court has considered factors such as lack of medical \\nevidence to prove whether the act/injury was individually sufficient \\nto cause death1, a single blow on head with a hammer2 and lack \\nof cogent evidence of the eye-witnesses that the accused shared a \\ncommon intention to commit murder3 as some factors to commute \\na sentence from Section 302 to Section 304 Part II IPC. \\n1\\t\\nBawa Singh v. State of Punjab, 1993 Supp (2) SCC 754.\\n2\\t\\nSarup Singh v. State of Haryana, (2009) 16 SCC 479.\\n3\\t\\nGhana Pradhan & Ors. v. State of Orissa, 1991 Supp (2) SCC 451.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R. \\b\\n11\\nVelthepu Srinivas and Others v. \\nState of Andhra Pradesh (Now State of Telangana) and Anr.\\n30.\\t Returning back to the facts of the case, there is certainly no escape \\nfrom coming to the conclusion that A-3 should have had the knowledge \\nthat the use of a stone to hit the head of the deceased is likely to cause \\ndeath. However, as demonstrated before, the evidence is insufficient \\nto deduce a conclusion that he shared a common intention with the \\nother accused to commit the murder of the deceased. Considering \\nthe role that A-3 has played, we hold him guilty of the offence under \\nSection 304 Part II IPC. \\n31.\\t The perusal of the evidence would reveal that it is not the case of \\nthe prosecution that A-3 was along with the other accused while the \\ndeceased was dragged to the house. The deposition would reveal \\nthat after the other accused assaulted the deceased with sword, A-3 \\ncame thereafter and assaulted the deceased with stone lying there. \\nWe, therefore, find that the prosecution has not been in a position \\nto establish that A-3 shared the common intention with the other \\naccused to cause the murder of the deceased.\\n32.\\t For the reasons stated above, we uphold the conviction and sentence \\nof A-1, A-2 and A-4 under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and \\ndismiss their Criminal Appeal No. 2852 of 2023 against the judgment \\nof the High Court of Telangana in Criminal Appeal No. 308 of 2005 \\ndated 26.04.2022. We acquit A-3 of the conviction and sentence \\nunder Section 302 read with Section 34 and convict him under \\nSection 304 Part II and sentence him to undergo imprisonment for \\n10 years. To this extent, the appeal of A-3 is allowed by altering the \\nconviction under Section 302 to Section 304 Part II IPC.\\n33.\\t Pending applications, if any, are disposed of. \\nHeadnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain\\b\\nResult of the case: Appeal disposed of.\",\n          \"Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court\\nJudgment\\nRajesh Bindal, J.\\nLeave granted.\\nBRIEF FACTS\\n2.\\t\\nThe present appeal has been filed by Child in Conflict with Law1 \\nimpugning the order2 passed by the High Court3.\\n3.\\t\\nVide aforesaid order, the High Court set aside the order dated \\n10.04.2023 passed by the Board4.\\n4.\\t\\nBriefly, the facts as available on record are that FIR5 was registered \\nagainst the CCL for commission of offences under sections 376(i), \\n342 IPC and sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Protection of Children from \\nSexual Offences Act, 20126.

The matter \\nwas adjourned to 05.04.2022 for order.\\n4.1\\t On 05.04.2022, the Principal Magistrate of the Board passed \\nan order holding that as per preliminary assessment report \\n1\\t\\nHereinafter referred to as \\u201cCCL\\u201d.\\n2\\t\\nOrder dated 15.11.2023 passed in Criminal Revision Petition No. 1243 of 2023.\\n3\\t\\nHigh Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru.\\n4\\t\\nAdditional Juvenile Justice Board, Bangalore City.\\n5\\t\\nCrime No. 239/2021 dated 03.11.2021.\\n6\\t\\nHereinafter referred to as \\u201c2012 Act\\u201d.\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n767\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nand the social investigation report, the CCL is to be tried as \\nan adult by the Children\\u2019s Court. The record was directed to \\nbe transferred to the Court concerned. However, when the file \\nwas put up before the Member of the Board for signatures, he \\nrecorded: \\u201cI am having a dissenting view to abovesaid order. I \\nwill pass detailed order on next date of hearing.\\u201d. The matter \\nwas adjourned to 12.04.2022. No separate order, as recorded \\nby the Member of the Board on 05.04.2022, was passed by \\nhim. On 12.04.2022 the matter was apparently heard afresh \\nby two Members of the Board without there being the Principal \\nMagistrate. Order was passed that as per the preliminary \\nassessment report and the social investigation report, the \\nenquiry regarding the alleged offence committed by the CCL \\nhas to be conducted by the Board as a juvenile.\\n4.2\\t An application under Section 19 of the Juvenile Justice (Care \\nand Protection of Children) Act, 20157 dated 18.10.2022 was \\nfiled by the complainant/mother of the victim before the Board \\nfor termination of proceedings and transferring the matter to \\nthe Children\\u2019s Court, to which objections were filed by the CCL.\\n4.3\\t Vide order dated 10.4.2023, the Board dismissed the application.\\n4.4\\t Impugning the aforesaid order, revision petition8 was filed by \\nthe Complainant before the High Court, which was allowed. \\nThe impugned order dated 10.04.2023 passed by the Board \\nwas set aside. The Board was directed to transmit the record \\nto the Children\\u2019s Court for trial.\\n4.5\\t The aforesaid order is under challenge before this Court by \\nthe CCL.\\nARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANT\\n5.\\t\\nMr. Sidharth Luthra and Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel \\nappearing for the CCL, submitted that the practice of passing order \\nwhile stating that the reasons will follow has been deprecated by \\nthis Court. It deprives the party concerned to avail of his appropriate \\n7\\t\\nHereinafter referred to as \\u201cthe Act\\u201d.\\n8\\t\\nCriminal Revision Petition No. 1243 of 2023.\\n768\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nremedy, when no reasons are available. In the case in hand, firstly \\nthe Principal Magistrate mentioned that the order was being passed \\nby him and another Member of the Board. However, the Member \\nof the Board did not sign the same. He only mentioned that he dis-\\nagrees with the views of the Principal Magistrate and will pass a \\ndetailed order on the next date. The matter was kept for 12.04.2022. \\nIn support of the arguments, reliance was placed upon the judgment \\nof this Court in Balaji Baliram Mupade and Another v. State of \\nMaharashtra and Others9.\\n5.1\\t It was further argued that the order passed on 05.04.2022 is not \\nan order in the eyes of law. The matter being listed on 12.04.2022, \\nthe arguments were heard by two Members of the Board including \\nthe Member who had earlier not signed the order. An order \\nwas passed directing that the enquiry into the offence shall be \\nconducted by the Board, treating the CCL as juvenile. He further \\nreferred to the documents placed on record with Crl. M.P. No. \\n28749 of 2024 that even the Principal Magistrate was present \\nin Court on that date. He had also heard the arguments but did \\nnot sign the order. There was a well-considered order passed \\non 12.04.2022, against which the only remedy available to the \\nvictim was to file an appeal. However, the same was not availed \\nof within the period provided for under Section 101 of the Act.\\n5.2\\t It was further submitted that after the commencement of trial \\nbefore the Board, nearly six months thereafter an application \\nwas filed for terminating the proceedings before the Board \\nand transferring the matter to the Children\\u2019s Court, to which \\nobjections were filed by the CCL. The Board appreciated the \\nposition of law correctly and dismissed the application filed by \\nthe mother of the victim.\\n5.3\\t It was submitted that even if for arguments\\u2019 sake it is assumed \\nthat the order passed on 12.04.2022 cannot be legally sustained. \\nIt may, at the most, revive the order dated 05.04.2022 against \\nwhich the CCL has a remedy of filing an appeal. However, in \\nview of the developments which had taken place since the \\npassing of the order on 12.04.2022, the CCL has been deprived \\n9\\t\\n(2021) 12 SCC 603 \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n769\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nof his remedy of appeal. If this Court is of the view that the \\norder passed on 05.04.2022 was an order, the CCL be given \\nliberty to avail remedy of appeal against the same, as with the \\npassing of the impugned order by the High Court, the CCL has \\nbeen left remediless against the order.\\n5.4\\t Section 15(1) of the Act provides for preliminary assessment \\nregarding mental status and physical capacity of the CCL, who \\nhad allegedly committed heinous offence. In case the Board is \\nsatisfied, that enquiry into the matter has to be conducted by \\nthe Board, it shall follow the procedure as prescribed. However, \\nan order can also be passed in terms of Section 18(3) of the \\nAct for trial of the CCL by the Children\\u2019s Court. It is only the \\nassessment, as to whether the Board or the Children\\u2019s Court \\nhas to hold inquiry or conduct trial. \\n5.5\\t Section 18(3) of the Act provides that after preliminary \\nassessment under Section 15 of the Act, the Board shall pass \\nan order that there is a need for trial of the CCL as an adult. \\nThe records of the case have to be transferred for trial to the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court having jurisdiction.\\n5.6\\t Section 17 of the Act provides for procedure in relation to the \\nBoard. It was submitted that the Board as such is not a court and \\nany proceeding conducted by the Board are not to be treated \\nas an order. It is merely an opinion. The Board, as defined in \\nsection 2(10) of the Act, means the Board as constituted under \\nsection 4 thereof. It shall consist of a Metropolitan Magistrate \\nor a Judicial Magistrate of First Class, not being the Chief \\nMetropolitan Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate with at \\nleast three years\\u2019 experience and two social workers selected \\nin the manner prescribed, one of them has to be a woman. \\n5.7\\t Section 7(3) of the Act provides that there shall be at least \\ntwo members including the Principal Magistrate present at the \\ntime of final disposal of a case or make an order under Section \\n18(3) of the Act.\\n5.8\\t It was further submitted that the appeal against an order passed \\nunder Section 18(3) of the Act by the Board, directing trial of the \\nCCL by the Children\\u2019s Court would lie to the Court of Sessions.\\n770\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n5.9\\t The term Children\\u2019s Court has been defined in Section 2(20) of the \\nAct. It means a Court established as such under the Commissions \\nfor Protection of Child Rights Act, 200510 or a Special Court under \\nthe 2012 Act, and where such Courts have not been designated, \\nthe Court of Sessions having jurisdiction. The argument is, that \\ntwo separate authorities have been mentioned in sub-sections (1) \\nand (2) of Section 101 of the Act, otherwise separate provisions \\nwere not required. This is the spirit of the law.\\n5.10\\tSection 19 of the Act deals with the powers of Children\\u2019s \\nCourt. After receipt of the preliminary assessment from the \\nBoard under Section 15, the Children\\u2019s Court may decide that \\nthe child is to be tried as an adult or that there is no need for \\ntrial of the CCL as an adult. An order passed by the Children\\u2019s \\nCourt is appealable before the High Court in terms of Section \\n101(5) of the Act.\\n5.11\\tReference was made to Rule 10A of the Juvenile Justice \\n(Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 201611 \\nwhich prescribes the procedure for preliminary assessment \\nregarding the age of the CCL under Section 14, and inquiry \\nby the Board or trial by the Children\\u2019s Court under Section \\n15 of the Act. \\n5.12\\tReferring to the aforesaid scheme of the Act, it was submitted \\nthat an assessment under Section 15 of the Act does not \\nenvisage passing of an order. It is merely a satisfaction \\nrecorded, and there is no final satisfaction recorded by the \\nBoard on 05.04.2022 as next date of hearing had been given. \\nThe matter had to be considered by the Board subsequently. \\nIn fact, no order had been passed under Section 18(3) of the \\nAct. Subsequent orders passed by the Board showed that the \\ninquiry had already commenced. It was at a later stage that the \\nComplainant filed an application for termination of proceedings \\nbefore the Board, which was dismissed on 10.04.2023. The \\norder was appealable under Section 101(1) of the Act. However, \\nno appeal was filed. A revision was filed before the High Court \\n10\\t\\nHereinafter referred to as \\u201c2005 Act\\u201d.\\n11\\t\\nHereinafter to be referred as \\u201cthe 2016 Rules\\u201d.\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n771\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nunder Section 397 read with Section 399 of the Cr.P.C., which \\nwas not maintainable.\\n5.13\\tIt was further argued that in terms of Section 14(3) of the \\nAct preliminary assessment under Section 15 thereof, has \\nto be made within a period of three months from the date \\nof first production of CCL before the Board. In the case in \\nhand, the child was produced before the Board for the first \\ntime on 03.11.2021. The period of three months expired on \\n02.02.2022. No order could possibly be passed by the Board \\non 05.04.2022. The result thereof is that the CCL is to be tried \\nby the Board and no order for his trial by the Children\\u2019s Court \\ncould be passed thereafter.\\n5.14\\tReliance was placed upon the judgment of this Court in Barun \\nChandra Thakur vs. Master Bholu & Anr.12 to submit that this \\nCourt opined that the timelines provided for under the Act have \\nto be adhered to. If the time provided for in Section 14(3) for \\npreliminary assessment under Section 15 cannot be extended, \\nno order for trial of the CCL by the Children\\u2019s Court can be \\npassed. Reliance was also placed upon judgment of this Court \\nin Shilpa Mittal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)13.\\nARGUMENTS OF RESPONDENTS\\n6.\\t\\nOn the other hand, learned counsel for the State submitted that even \\nafter the order is passed by the Board transferring the matter to the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court for trial of the CCL, it can be reconsidered by the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court under Section 19(1) of the Act. Any order passed by \\nthe Children\\u2019s Court is appealable under Section 101(5) of the Act. \\nThe scope of Section 101(1) and 101(2) is different. Sub-section (1) \\ndeals with final orders, whereas sub-section (2) deals with preliminary \\nassessment. The trial of the offence is only by the Children\\u2019s Court.\\n6.1\\t It was further submitted that, in terms of proviso to Section \\n15(1) of the Act, the Board may take assistance of experienced \\npsychologists, psycho-social workers or other experts to enable \\nthe Board to reach a proper conclusion. \\n12\\t\\n[2022] 10 SCR 595 : 2022 INSC 716\\n13\\t\\n(2020) 2 SCR 478 : (2020) 2 SCC 787 : 2020 INSC 25\\n772\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n6.2\\t In this case, a report dated 01.02.2022 has been submitted by \\nthe Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, NIMHANS-\\nDWCO. It was in response to a letter dated 12.01.2022 from the \\nPolice Inspector, Marathahalli Police Station to the Psychiatrist, \\nNIMHANS Hospital, Bengaluru. Going backward, learned \\ncounsel for the State referred to the interim order of the Board \\ndated 09.11.2021 in terms of which the Board had called for \\nthe social investigation report of the child to enable the Board \\nto pass further order in terms of Section 18(3) of the Act. \\nHowever, no report was produced on 06.12.2021. The matter \\nwas adjourned from 06.12.2021 to 11.01.2022, and thereafter \\nto 21.02.2022. The Social Investigation Report was received \\nby the Board on 19.02.2022.\\n6.3\\t The arguments on the issue of trial of the CCL by the Children\\u2019s \\nCourt or inquiry by the Board, were completed on 29.03.2022 \\nand the matter was adjourned to 05.04.2022 for orders, when \\nthe Principal Magistrate passed an order directing for trial \\nof the CCL by the Children\\u2019s Court. Another member of the \\nBoard did not append his signature and recorded that he had a \\ndissenting view and would pass the detailed order on the next \\ndate i.e. 12.04.2022. In fact, in terms of Section 7(4) of the Act, \\nthe proceeding for determination of the forum, which was to \\nconduct the inquiry or trial, concluded on that day itself, as the \\nopinion of the Principal Magistrate is final. The manner in which \\nthe case was dealt with subsequently, is strange. Subsequent \\norder dated 12.04.2022 was passed by different members of \\nthe Board. The entire proceedings were non-est. There was no \\nerror in the application moved by the victim for termination of \\nproceedings before the Board and referring the matter to the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court, for which an order had already been passed \\nby the Principal Magistrate on 05.04.2022.\\n6.4\\t It was further argued that merely because proceedings under \\nSection 15 of the Act could not be concluded within three \\nmonths, by default the CCL will not be tried by the Board. The \\nprovision cannot be held to be mandatory, as no consequence \\nof such a default has been provided in the Act. Even proviso to \\nSection 14(4) provides for extension of time in case the inquiry \\nas envisaged under Section 14(1) cannot be concluded within \\nthe time prescribed. \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n773\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\n6.5\\t It was further submitted that though there is no direct judgment \\nof this Court in this matter dealing with Section 14(3) of the \\nAct. However, the learned counsel for the State referred to \\nthe following judgments of the Madhya Pradesh, Punjab & \\nHaryana and Delhi High Courts Bhola vs State of Madhya \\nPradesh14, Neeraj and Others vs State of Haryana15 and \\nX vs. State16.\\n6.6\\t It was further argued that the inquiry envisaged under Section \\n15 of the Act provides for taking opinion from experienced \\npsychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts. The \\nrole of investigating officer is also relevant as he is investigating \\nthe same. There can be intentional delays caused in the process \\nalso to take benefit, in case by default CCL in a heinous \\noffence is to be tried by the Board. As in the case in hand the \\ninvestigating officer himself took about two months in getting \\nthe report from NIMHANS. In such a situation the Board should \\nnot be treated as powerless to extend the time for reasons to \\nbe recorded. No doubt, in such a matter all the proceedings \\nhave to be completed as expeditiously as possible.\\n6.7\\t It was further submitted that there is no merit in the arguments \\nraised by the learned counsel for the appellant, to give him \\nliberty to challenge the order dated 05.04.2022 in case he has \\ngrievance against the same. Much water has flown thereafter. \\nAll possible arguments were raised in the revision decided by \\nthe High Court, and considered. To give liberty to the appellant \\nto raise the same before a lower authority would be an exercise \\nin futility. The same would rather result in delaying the process \\nfurther. The prayer is for the dismissal of the appeal.\\nDISCUSSION\\n7.\\t\\nHeard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant \\nreferred record.

The \\npreliminary assessment is to be conducted with regard to his mental \\nand physical capacity to commit such an offence, ability to understand \\nthe consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which the \\noffence was allegedly committed. Proviso to the aforesaid section \\nprovides that for making such an assessment the Board may take \\nassistance of an experienced psychologist or psycho-social worker \\nor other experts. Explanation thereto provides that the process of \\npreliminary assessment is not a trial but merely to assess the capacity \\nof such a child to commit and understand the consequences of the \\nalleged offence. The importance of the assistance from the expert \\nis even evident from Section 101(2) of the Act. While considering \\nthe appeal against an order passed under Section 15, the appellate \\nauthority can also take assistance of experts other than those who \\nassisted the Board.\\n9.1\\t The importance of the aforesaid provision was considered by \\nthis Court in Barun Chandra Thakur\\u2019s case (supra) where \\nrequirement of such assistance was held to be mandatory, even \\nthough the words used in proviso to Section 15(1) and Section \\n101(2) of the Act are \\u2018may\\u2019.\\n9.2\\t Section 14(3) of the Act provides that the preliminary assessment \\nin terms of Section 15 is to be completed by the Board within \\na period of three months from the date of first production of \\nthe child before the Board.\\n790\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n9.3\\t In case the Board after preliminary assessment under Section \\n15 of the Act comes to a conclusion that the trial of the CCL is \\nto be conducted as an adult, then the Board shall transfer the \\nrecords to the Children\\u2019s Court having jurisdiction.\\n9.4\\t The argument raised by learned counsel for the appellant was \\nthat the CCL was produced before the Board on 03.11.2021. \\nThe period of three months having expired on 02.02.2022, any \\norder passed by the Board thereafter is non-est, and the trial of \\nCCL cannot now be transferred to the Children\\u2019s Court.\\n9.5\\t What we need to consider is as to whether the timeline for \\nthe conclusion of inquiry as envisaged under Section 14 is \\nmandatory or directory?\\n9.6\\t As per the scheme of Section 14 of the Act, sub-section (1) \\nthereof provides that, when a CCL is produced before the Board, \\nafter holding inquiry, it may pass order in relation to such CCL \\nas it deems fit under Section 17 and 18 of the Act.\\n9.7\\t Section 17 of the Act envisages the order regarding a child \\nnot found to be in conflict with the law. Whereas Section 18 \\n(1) envisages an order passed in case a child is found to be \\nin conflict with law. It includes child of the age of 16 years and \\nabove, who is involved in a heinous offence, but inquiry to be \\nconducted by the Board.\\n9.8\\t Section 14(2) of the Act provides that the inquiry as envisaged \\nunder Section 14(1) thereof shall be completed within a period \\nof four months from the date of first production of the child \\nbefore the Board. The time is extendable by the Board for a \\nmaximum period of two months, for the reasons to be recorded. \\nThe consequences of non-conclusion of any such inquiry have \\nbeen provided in Section 14(4) of the Act, only with reference to \\npetty offences. The aforesaid sub-section provides that if inquiry \\nby the Board under sub-section (2) for petty offences remains \\ninconclusive even after the extended period, the proceedings \\nshall stand terminated. Proviso to the aforesaid sub-section \\nprovides that in case the Board requires further extension of \\ntime for completion of inquiry into serious and heinous offences, \\nthe same shall be granted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or, \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n791\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nas the case may be, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, for \\nreasons to be recorded in writing. \\n9.9\\t Meaning thereby that as far as inquiry of CCL, as envisaged \\nunder Section 14(1) of the Act, by the Board for heinous offences \\nis concerned, there is no deadline after which either the inquiry \\ncannot be proceeded further or has to be terminated.\\n9.10\\tNow coming to the issue in hand. It is not in dispute that the \\nCCL has allegedly committed a heinous offences. The argument \\nis with reference to the period provided for the conclusion of \\npreliminary assessment under Section 15 of the Act and passing \\nof an order under Section 15(2) or 18(3) of the Act, namely as \\nto whether the matter is to be enquired into by the Board or \\nis to be transferred to the Children\\u2019s Court for trial of the CCL \\nas an adult.\\n9.11\\tWe may add here that apparently the placement of Section \\n18(3) does not seem to be appropriate. Sub-sections (1) and \\n(2) of Section 18 deal with final orders to be passed by the \\nBoard on inquiry against the CCL, whereas sub-section (3) \\nenvisages passing of an order by the Board as to whether the \\ntrial of CCL is to be conducted by the Children\\u2019s Court in terms \\nof preliminary assessment, as envisaged in Section 15 thereof. \\nPassing of such an order could very well be placed in Section \\n15 itself after sub-section (2) thereof.\\n9.12\\tThe inquiry as envisaged in Section 15(1) of the Act enables \\nthe Board to take assistance from experienced psychologists or \\npsycho-social workers or other experts. The proviso has nexus \\nwith the object sought to be achieved. The Act deals with the \\nCCL. The preliminary assessment as envisaged in Section 15 \\nhas large ramifications, namely, as to whether inquiry against \\nthe CCL is to be conducted by the Board, where the final \\npunishment, which could be inflicted is lighter or the trial is to \\nbe conducted by the Children\\u2019s Court treating the CCL as an \\nadult, where the punishment could be stringent.\\n9.13\\tAs noticed earlier, the preliminary assessment into the heinous \\noffence by the Board in terms of Section 15(1) of the Act has to \\nbe concluded within a period of three months in terms of Section \\n14(3) of the Act. The Act as such does not provide for any \\n792\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nextension of time and also does not lay down the consequence \\nof non-compilation of inquiry within the time permissible. In the \\nabsence thereof the provision prescribing time limit of completion \\nof inquiry cannot be held to be mandatory. The intention of the \\nlegislature with reference to serious or heinous offences is also \\navailable from the language of Section 14 of the Act which itself \\nprovides for further extension of time for completion of inquiry \\nby the Board to be granted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or \\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate for the reasons to be recorded \\nin writing. It is in addition to two months\\u2019 extension which the \\nBoard itself can grant. \\n9.14\\tAs in the process of preliminary inquiry there is involvement \\nof many persons, namely, the investigating officer, the experts \\nwhose opinion is to be obtained, and thereafter the proceedings \\nbefore the Board, where for different reasons any of the party \\nmay be able to delay the proceedings, in our opinion the time \\nso provided in Section 14(3) cannot be held to be mandatory, \\nas no consequences of failure have been provided as is there in \\ncase of enquiry into petty offences in terms of Section 14(4) of \\nthe Act. If we see the facts of the case in hand, the investigating \\nofficer had taken about two months\\u2019 time in getting the report \\nfrom the NIMHANS.\\n9.15\\tWhere consequences for default for a prescribed period in \\na Statute are not mentioned, the same cannot be held to be \\nmandatory. For this purpose, reference can be made to the \\nfollowing decisions of this Court. \\n9.16\\tThis Court in Topline Shoes Ltd vs Corporation Bank17 \\nwhile interpretating Section 13(2)(a) of the repealed Consumer \\nProtection Act, 1986 prescribing time limit for filing reply to the \\ncomplaint, held the same to be directory in nature. Relevant \\npara 11 thereof is extracted below:\\n\\u201c11. We have already noticed that the provision as \\ncontained under clause (a) of sub-section (2) of \\nSection 13 is procedural in nature. It is also clear that \\nwith a view to achieve the object of the enactment, that \\n17\\t\\n[2002] 3 SCR 1167 : (2002) 6 SCC 33 : 2002 INSC 287\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n793\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nthere may be speedy disposal of such cases, that it has \\nbeen provided that reply is to be filed within 30 days \\nand the extension of time may not exceed 15 days. \\nThis provision envisages that proceedings may not \\nbe prolonged for a very long time without the opposite \\nparty having filed his reply. No penal consequences \\nhave however been provided in case extension of time \\nexceeds 15 days. Therefore, it could not be said that \\nany substantive right accrued in favour of the appellant \\nor there was any kind of bar of limitation in filing of \\nthe reply within extended time though beyond 45 days \\nin all. The reply is not necessarily to be rejected. All \\nfacts and circumstances of the case must be taken \\ninto account. The Statement of Objects and Reasons \\nof the Act also provides that the principles of natural \\njustice have also to be kept in mind.\\u201d\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n9.17\\tThis Court in Kailash vs Nanhku and Others18 while \\ninterpretating Order VIII Rule 1 CPC prescribing time limit for \\nfiling written statement, held the same to be directory in nature. \\nRelevant paras 30 and 46 thereof are extracted below:\\n\\u201c30. It is also to be noted that though the power of \\nthe court under the proviso appended to Rule 1 Order \\n8 is circumscribed by the words \\u201cshall not be later \\nthan ninety days\\u201d but the consequences flowing from \\nnon-extension of time are not specifically provided for \\nthough they may be read in by necessary implication. \\nMerely because a provision of law is couched in a \\nnegative language implying mandatory character, the \\nsame is not without exceptions. The courts, when \\ncalled upon to interpret the nature of the provision, \\nmay, keeping in view the entire context in which the \\nprovision came to be enacted, hold the same to be \\ndirectory though worded in the negative form.\\nx\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003x\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003x\\n18\\t\\n[2005] 3 SCR 289 : (2005) 4 SCC 480 : 2005 INSC 186\\n794\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n46. We sum up and briefly state our conclusions as \\nunder:\\n(i) - (iii) \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003xxxx\\n(iv) The purpose of providing the time schedule \\nfor filing the written statement under Order 8 \\nRule 1 CPC is to expedite and not to scuttle the \\nhearing. The provision spells out a disability on \\nthe defendant. It does not impose an embargo \\non the power of the court to extend the time. \\nThough the language of the proviso to Rule 1 \\nOrder 8 CPC is couched in negative form, it does \\nnot specify any penal consequences flowing \\nfrom the non-compliance. The provision being \\nin the domain of the procedural law, it has to \\nbe held directory and not mandatory. The power \\nof the court to extend time for filing the written \\nstatement beyond the time schedule provided \\nby Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is not completely taken \\naway.\\n(v) Though Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is a part of \\nprocedural law and hence directory, keeping \\nin view the need for expeditious trial of civil \\ncauses which persuaded Parliament to enact \\nthe provision in its present form, it is held that \\nordinarily the time schedule contained in the \\nprovision is to be followed as a rule and departure \\ntherefrom would be by way of exception. A prayer \\nfor extension of time made by the defendant shall \\nnot be granted just as a matter of routine and \\nmerely for the asking, more so when the period \\nof 90 days has expired. Extension of time may \\nbe allowed by way of an exception, for reasons \\nto be assigned by the defendant and also be \\nplaced on record in writing, howsoever briefly, \\nby the court on its being satisfied. Extension \\nof time may be allowed if it is needed to be \\ngiven for circumstances which are exceptional, \\noccasioned by reasons beyond the control of \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n795\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nthe defendant and grave injustice would be \\noccasioned if the time was not extended. Costs \\nmay be imposed and affidavit or documents in \\nsupport of the grounds pleaded by the defendant \\nfor extension of time may be demanded, \\ndepending on the facts and circumstances of \\na given case.\\u201d\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n9.18\\tThis Court in State of Bihar and Others vs Bihar Rajya \\nBhumi Vikas Bank Samiti19 while section 34 (5) and (6) of the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 held the period prescribed \\nin sub-section (6) to be directory. The relevant paras 23, 25 \\nand 26 are extracted below:\\n\\u201c23. It will be seen from this provision that, unlike \\nSections 34(5) and (6), if an award is made beyond \\nthe stipulated or extended period contained in the \\nsection, the consequence of the mandate of the \\narbitrator being terminated is expressly provided. \\nThis provision is in stark contrast to Sections 34(5) \\nand (6) where, as has been stated hereinabove, if \\nthe period for deciding the application under Section \\n34 has elapsed, no consequence is provided. This is \\none more indicator that the same Amendment Act, \\nwhen it provided time periods in different situations, \\ndid so intending different consequences.\\nx\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003x\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003x\\n25.We come now to some of the High Court judgments. \\nThe High Courts of Patna [Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas \\nBank Samiti v. State of Bihar, 2016 SCC OnLine Pat \\n10104], Kerala [Shamsudeen v. Shreeram Transport \\nFinance Co. Ltd., 2016 SCC OnLine Ker 23728], \\nHimachal Pradesh [Madhava Hytech Engineers (P) \\nLtd. v.

Durga Krishna Store \\n(P) Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Gau 907] have all taken \\nthe view that Section 34(5) is mandatory in nature. \\nWhat is strongly relied upon is the object sought \\nto be achieved by the provision together with the \\nmandatory nature of the language used in Section \\n34(5). Equally, analogies with Section 80 CPC have \\nbeen drawn to reach the same result. On the other \\nhand, in Global Aviation Services (P) Ltd. v. Airport \\nAuthority of India [Global Aviation Services (P) Ltd. \\nv. Airport Authority of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Bom \\n233] , the Bombay High Court, in answering Question \\n4 posed by it, held, following some of our judgments, \\nthat the provision is directory, largely because no \\nconsequence has been provided for breach of the \\ntime-limit specified. When faced with the argument \\nthat the object of the provision would be rendered \\notiose if it were to be construed as directory, the \\nlearned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court held \\nas under: (SCC OnLine Bom para 133)\\n\\u201c133. Insofar as the submission of the learned \\ncounsel for the respondent that if Section 34(5) \\nis considered as directory, the entire purpose \\nof the amendments would be rendered otiose \\nis concerned, in my view, there is no merit in \\nthis submission made by the learned counsel for \\nthe respondent. Since there is no consequence \\nprovided in the said provision in case of non-\\ncompliance thereof, the said provision cannot \\nbe considered as mandatory. The purpose of \\navoiding any delay in proceeding with the matter \\nexpeditiously is already served by insertion \\nof appropriate rule in the Bombay High Court \\n(Original Side) Rules. The Court can always \\ndirect the petitioner to issue notice along with \\npapers and proceedings upon other party before \\nthe matter is heard by the Court for admission \\nas well as for final hearing. The vested rights \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n797\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nof a party to challenge an award under Section \\n34 cannot be taken away for non-compliance \\nof issuance of prior notice before filing of the \\narbitration petition.\\u201d\\nThe aforesaid judgment has been followed by recent \\njudgments of the High Courts of Bombay [Maharashtra \\nState Road Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Simplex \\nGayatri Consortium, 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 805] and \\nCalcutta [Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. v. Candor \\nGurgaon Two Developers and Projects (P) Ltd., 2018 \\nSCC OnLine Cal 5606].\\n26. We are of the opinion that the view propounded by \\nthe High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta represents \\nthe correct state of the law. However, we may add \\nthat it shall be the endeavour of every court in which \\na Section 34 application is filed, to stick to the time-\\nlimit of one year from the date of service of notice \\nto the opposite party by the applicant, or by the \\nCourt, as the case may be. In case the Court issues \\nnotice after the period mentioned in Section 34(3) \\nhas elapsed, every court shall endeavour to dispose \\nof the Section 34 application within a period of one \\nyear from the date of filing of the said application, \\nsimilar to what has been provided in Section 14 of \\nthe Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and \\nCommercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, \\n2015.

True it is not permissible to read words in a statute \\nwhich are not there, but \\u201cwhere the alternative lies \\nbetween either supplying by implication words which \\nappear to have been accidentally omitted, or adopting \\na construction which deprives certain existing words \\nof all meaning, it is permissible to supply the words\\u201d \\n(Craies Statute Law, 7th edn., p.109). Similar are \\nthe observations in Hameedia Hardware Stores v. \\nB. Mohan Lal Sowcar, (1988) 2 SCC 513, 524-25 \\nwhere it was observed that the court construing a \\nprovision should not easily read into it words which \\nhave not been expressly enacted but having regard \\nto the context in which a provision appears and the \\nobject of the statute in which the said provision is \\nenacted the court should construe it in a harmonious \\n22\\t\\n[2010] 8 SCR 1053 : (2010) 8 SCC 24 : 2010 INSC 431\\n23\\t\\n[1991] 1 SCR 364 : (1991) 2 SCC 87 : 1991 INSC 36\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n801\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nway to make it meaningful. An attempt must always \\nbe made so to reconcile the relevant provisions as to \\nadvance the remedy intended by the statute. (See: \\nSirajul Haq Khan v. Sunni Central Board of Waqf, \\n1959 SCR 1287, 1299:AIR 1959 SC 198)\\u201d\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n9.25\\tThe issue was thereafter considered by this Court in Rajbir \\nSingh Dalal (Dr.) vs. Chaudhari Devi Lal University, Sirsa \\nand Another24. In the aforesaid case this Court observed as: \\n\\u2018where the alternative lies between either supplying by implication \\nwords which appear to have been accidentally omitted, or \\nadopting a strict construction which leads to absurdity or deprives \\ncertain existing words of all meaning, and in this situation it is \\npermissible to supply the words (vide Principles of Statutory \\nInterpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., pp.71-76)\\u2019. This \\nCourt also considered the traditional principles of interpretation \\nknown as the \\u2018Mimansa rules of interpretation\\u2019. The issue under \\nconsideration in the aforesaid case was regarding requisite \\nacademic qualification for appointment to the post of Reader \\nin the University in Public Administration. Applying the tools of \\ninterpretation, this Court opined that \\u2018relevant subject\\u2019 should \\nbe inserted in the qualification required for the post of Reader \\nafter the words \\u2018at the Masters degree level\\u2019 to give the rules \\na purposive interpretation by filling in the gap.\\n9.26\\tThe same principles were followed by this Court in Central \\nBureau of Investigation, Bank Securities and Fraud Cell \\nvs. Ramesh Gelli and Others25.\\n9.27\\tIn our opinion, the guidance as is evident from sub-section (4) \\nof section 14 of the Act enabling the Chief Judicial Magistrate \\nor Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to extend the period of inquiry \\nas envisaged under Section 14(1), shall apply for extension of \\nperiod as envisaged in sub-section (3) also. Such an extension \\ncan be granted for a limited period for the reasons to be recorded \\nin writing. While considering the prayer for extension of time, \\n24\\t\\n[2008] 11 SCR 992 : (2008) 9 SCC 284 : 2008 INSC 913\\n25\\t\\n[2016] 1 SCR 762 : (2016) 3 SCC 788 : 2016 INSC 134\\n802\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe delay in receipt of opinion of the experts shall be a relevant \\nfactor. This shall be in the spirit of the Act and giving the same \\na purposive meaning.\\n9.28\\tWe approve the views expressed by the High Court of Madhya \\nPradesh in Bhola vs State of Madhya Pradesh26 and the High \\nCourt in Delhi in CCL vs State (NCT) of Delhi27 who while \\ndealing with the provisions of section 14 of the Act have held \\nthat the time period prescribed for completion of the preliminary \\nassessment is not mandatory but merely directory in nature. \\nWe also approve the views expressed by the High Court of \\nthe Punjab and Haryana in Neeraj and Others vs State of \\nHaryana28 and by the High Court of Delhi in X (Through his \\nElder Brother) vs State29 who also expressed similar views \\nwhile dealing with the pari materia provisions of the repealed \\nJuvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000.\\nIII.\\t\\nEXERCISE OF REVISIONAL POWER BY THE HIGH COURT\\n10.\\t The order under challenge in the present appeal was passed by the \\nHigh Court in revision filed by the complainant, impugning the order \\ndated 10.04.2023 passed by the Board vide which the application \\nfiled by her under section 19 of the Act for termination of proceedings \\nbefore the Board and transferring the case to the Children\\u2019s Court \\nfor trial, was rejected. It was for the reason that the order passed by \\nthe Principal Magistrate on 05.04.2022 was final in terms of Section \\n7(4) of the Act, as no majority opinion could have been given.\\n10.1\\tIn terms of the provision of law, the CCL could have grievance \\nagainst that order and availed of his remedy against the same \\nbut, the proceedings were allowed to be continued further. Lesser \\nsaid the better as to how two members of the Board without the \\nPrincipal Magistrate being there had conducted the proceedings \\ntaking a different view in the matter. It is relevant to note that \\nwhen subsequent order was passed by two members of the \\nBoard on 12.04.2022, the Principal Magistrate had already been \\n26\\t\\n2019 SCC OnLine MP 521\\n27\\t\\n2023 SCC OnLine Del 5063\\n28\\t\\n2005 SCC OnLine P&H 611\\n29\\t\\n2019 SCC OnLine Del 11164\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n803\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\ntransferred, as is evident from impugned order of the High Court \\n(para 19). In fact, the order passed by the two members of the \\nBoard on 12.04.2022 directing inquiry in the case by the Board \\nwas non-est in the eyes of law, if considered strictly in terms \\nof Section 7(4) of the Act. From various orders passed by the \\nBoard, it is evident that the inquiry could not proceed further \\neither on account of the absence of the Presiding Officer or APP \\n(Public Prosecutor) or the witnesses summoned. At that stage, \\nan application was moved by the complainant for termination of \\nproceedings before the Board and transferring the matter to the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court, to which objections were filed by the appellant. \\nThe Board vide order dated 10.04.2023 dismissed the application \\nholding that the complainant had a right of appeal against the \\norder dated 12.04.2022, which could have been availed and \\nthe Board does not have any power to review its order. The \\naforesaid order was challenged by the complainant before the \\nHigh Court by filing the Revision Petition invoking power under \\nSection 397 read with Section 399 Cr.P.C. It is the order passed \\nin the aforesaid petition which is impugned before this Court.\\n10.2\\tFirstly, the issue is mentioning of Section 397 read with Section \\n399 Cr. P.C for filing revision petition before the High Court \\nand about its maintainability on that account. Nothing hinges \\non that, as it was mere mentioning of a wrong section in the \\npetition. The High Court otherwise has the power to deal with \\nthe subject-matter. Section 102 of the Act enables the High \\nCourt to exercise its revisional powers with reference to any \\norder or proceeding by the Board or the Children\\u2019s Court. \\nHence, on that account we do not find that the revision should \\nhave been dismissed.\\n10.3\\tAnother argument raised by learned counsel for the appellant was \\nthat there being remedy of appeal available with the complainant \\nagainst the order dated 12.04.2024 vide which two members of \\nthe Board had directed inquiry into the offence allegedly committed \\nby CCL by the Board. In our opinion, even though such a remedy \\nmay be available to the complainant which should normally be \\navailed, but what is evident from the facts of the case is that \\nthere was an earlier order passed by the Principal Magistrate \\non 05.04.2022, which was final regarding conduct of trial of the \\n804\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nCCL by the Children\\u2019s Court, still subsequently two members of \\nthe Board without the Principal Magistrate being there passed \\nan order on 12.04.2022 directing inquiry into the offence by the \\nBoard. In fact, the subsequent order was totally non-est. Even \\nif in such a situation the aforesaid order was not challenged by \\navailing the remedy of appeal, in our opinion the revision under \\nSection 102 of the Act cannot be said to be not maintainable.\\n10.4\\tFirstly, there is no time limit provided for filing a revision therein, \\nand secondly it could be on an application filed by any of the \\nparties. The High Court can exercise its revisional powers for \\nsatisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any such order \\nand may pass such order in relation thereto as it thinks fit. \\nBesides the legality of the order dated 12.04.2022, the case in \\nhand is such where even the propriety of the proceeding was \\nalso in question. The proceedings before the Board could not \\ncontinue after the passing of the order dated 05.04.2022, in \\nterms of Section 7(4) of the Act. \\n10.5\\tHence, non-availment of the remedy of appeal by the complainant \\nin such a situation cannot be held to be fatal. We may also add \\nhere that even the appellant could have availed the remedy of \\nappeal against the order dated 05.04.2022, but he thought of \\ncontinuing before the Board in a non-est proceeding.\\nIV.\\t\\nANOMALY IN SECTION 101 OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE \\n(CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015\\n(A)\\t REGARDING THE TERMS USED AS \\u2018CHILDREN\\u2019S \\nCOURT\\u2019 AND \\u2018COURT OF SESSIONS\\u2019\\n11.\\t Section 101 of the Act provides for appeal against various orders as \\nprovided therein. Sub-section (1) thereof provides that any person \\naggrieved by an order made by the Committee or the Board under \\nthe Act may within 30 days from the date of such order prefer an \\nappeal to the Children\\u2019s Court, with an exception that against decision \\nof the Committee relating to foster care and sponsorship care the \\nappeal shall lie to the District Magistrate. The term \\u2018Committee\\u2019 has \\nbeen defined in Section 2(22) of the Act to mean \\u2018Child Welfare \\nCommittee\\u2019 constituted under Section 27 thereof. \\nThe proviso to sub-section (1) of section 101 provides that the Court \\nof Sessions or District Magistrate, as the case may be, may entertain \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n805\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nthe appeal after expiry of the period of 30 days in case sufficient \\ncause is shown for the delay in filing.\\n11.1\\tSub-section (2) of Section 101 provides that an appeal against the \\norder passed by the Board after making preliminary assessment \\nunder Section 15 of the Act shall lie before the Court of \\nSessions. While deciding the appeal, the Court can take \\nassistance of experienced psychologists and medical specialists, \\nother than those whose assistance was taken by the Board while \\npassing the order impugned. It shows independent examination \\nof the issue. Sub-section (4) provides that, no second appeal will \\nbe maintainable from the order passed by the Court of Sessions. \\nIn Barun Chandra Thakur\\u2019s case (supra) the provisions have \\nbeen held to be mandatory.\\n11.2\\tSome anomalies are evident in the aforesaid proviso, as \\npointed out by the learned counsel for the parties at the time \\nof hearing. Their contention was that the anomalies should also \\nbe addressed, so as to streamline the procedure in future. We \\nalso think in the same direction, keeping in view the spirit of law.\\n11.3\\tThe term Court of Sessions as such has not been defined in the \\nAct. The trial of CCL, who is of the age of 16 years or above \\nand is involved in a heinous offence is to be conducted by the \\nChildren\\u2019s Court, treating him as an adult. \\n11.4\\t\\u2018Children\\u2019s Court\\u2019 has been defined in the Act in Section 2(20) \\nto mean the Court established under the 2005 Act or a Special \\nCourt established under the 2012 Act. Where such Courts are \\nnot existing, the Court of Sessions shall have jurisdiction to try \\nthe offence under the Act. Meaning thereby the Presiding Officer \\nof the Children\\u2019s Court and the Court of Sessions have been \\nput in same bracket. There is no doubt with the proposition \\nthat a Sessions Judge would include an Additional Sessions \\nJudge as well. \\n11.5\\tSection 25 of the 2005 Act provides that for providing speedy \\ntrial of offences against children or violation of child rights, the \\nState Government in concurrence with the Chief Justice of the \\nHigh Court by notification specify at least a Court in the State \\nor for each district a Court of Sessions to be a Children\\u2019s Court. \\nMeaning thereby the Special Court under the 2005 Act is at the \\nlevel of the Sessions Court.\\n806\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n11.6\\t Section 101(1) of the Act deals with filing of appeals against \\ncertain orders passed by the Board or the Committee before \\nthe Children\\u2019s Court, as the case may be. The proviso to the \\naforesaid sub-section provides that in case there is any delay \\nin filing the appeal, the power of condonation has been vested \\nwith the Court of Sessions. The word \\u2018Children\\u2019s Court\\u2019 is not \\nmentioned, though appeal is maintainable before Children\\u2019s \\nCourt.\\n11.7\\tSub-section (2) of Section 101 of the Act provides for an appeal \\nagainst an order passed by the Board under Section 15 of the \\nAct. The appellate authority is stated to be Court of Sessions.\\n11.8\\tRule 13 of the 2016 Rules deals with the procedure in relation \\nto Children\\u2019s Court and Monitoring Authorities. Sub-rules (3) \\nand (4) thereof which deal with appeal filed under Section \\n101(2) of the Act refer the appellate authority as the \\u2018Children\\u2019s \\nCourt\\u2019 though in Section 101(2) of the Act appeal is stated to \\nbe maintainable before the Court of Sessions. From the above \\nprovision also, it is evident that the words \\u2018Court of Sessions\\u2019 \\nand the \\u2018Children\\u2019s Court\\u2019 have been used interchangeably.\\n12.\\t Section 102 of the Act provides for revisional power of the High \\nCourt. This again talks of calling for records of any proceedings \\nin which a Committee or a Board or Children\\u2019s Court or Court has \\npassed an order. It does not talk of exercise of revisional power \\nagainst the order passed by the Sessions Court. To put the record \\nstraight, it is added that the term \\u2018court\\u2019 has been defined in the \\nAct in Section 2(23) to mean a civil court, which has jurisdiction in \\nmatters of adoption and guardianship and may include the District \\nCourt, Family Court and City Civil Courts. \\n12.1\\tSimilarly, sub-section (2) provides that against an order passed \\nby the Board after preliminary assessment under Section 15 of \\nthe Act, the appeal is maintainable before the Court of Sessions. \\nThe Board is headed by the Principal Magistrate. Here, the \\nword Children\\u2019s Court is not mentioned.\\n12.2\\tFrom a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions of the Act \\nand the 2016 Rules, in our opinion, wherever words \\u2018Children\\u2019s \\nCourt\\u2019 or the \\u2018Sessions Court\\u2019 are mentioned both should be \\nread in alternative. In the sense where Children\\u2019s Court is \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n807\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\navailable, even if the appeal is said to be maintainable before \\nthe Sessions Court, it has to be considered by the Children\\u2019s \\nCourt. Whereas where no Children\\u2019s Court is available, the \\npower is to be exercised by the Sessions Court.\\n(B)\\t TIME FOR FILING APPEAL AGAINST ORDER OF THE \\nBOARD UNDER SECTION 15 OF THE ACT\\n13.\\t Though, the right of appeal has been provided in Section 15(2) and \\nSection 101(2) of the Act against an order passed under Section \\n18(3) after preliminary assessment under Section 15 of the Act, \\nhowever, neither any time has been fixed for filing the appeal nor \\nany provision is provided for condonation of delay in case need be.\\n13.1\\tIn our opinion, the same being an omission. In order to make \\nthe Act workable and putting timelines for exercise of statutory \\nright of appeal which always is there, we deem it appropriate \\nto fill up this gap, which otherwise does not go against the \\nscheme of the Act. Hence, for the period for filing of appeal \\nin Section 101(2), we take guidance from Section 101(1) of \\nthe Act. The period provided for filing the appeal therein is \\n30 days and in case sufficient cause is shown the power to \\ncondone the delay has also been conferred on the appellate \\nauthority. Timeline has also been provided for decision of \\nappeal.\\n13.2\\tOrdered accordingly.\\n(C)\\t REGARDING SECOND APPEAL\\n14.\\t In sub-section (4), it is provided that no second appeal shall lie from \\nthe order of Sessions Court. Sub-section (5) provides for appeal to \\nthe High Court against an order of Children\\u2019s Court, for this procedure \\nof CrPC is applicable, as if the second appeal may lie against the \\norder passed by the Children\\u2019s Court. High Court has also been \\nconferred revisional powers under Section 102 of the Act.\\n14.1\\tThe aforesaid provisions will also need examination in detail \\nfor seamless working of the provisions of the Act removing \\nanomalies. However, as this is not the issue involved in the \\npresent appeal and no arguments have been addressed \\nthereon, hence, we leave this issue open to be considered in \\nsome appropriate case.\\n808\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nV.\\t\\nVALIDITY OF ORDER PASSED BY THE BOARD ON \\n05.04.2022\\n15.\\t In the case in hand, after receipt of the report dated 01.02.2022 \\nsubmitted by the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \\nNIMHANS-DWCO, the arguments of learned counsel for the parties \\nwere heard by the Board and vide order dated 29.03.2022 the \\nmatter was kept for orders on 05.04.2022. On that day, the Principal \\nMagistrate passed the order, after considering the preliminary \\nassessment report and the social investigation report, that the CCL \\nis to be tried by the Children\\u2019s Court as an adult. The records of \\nthe case were directed to be transferred to the Children\\u2019s Court, \\nBengaluru. When the file was put up before the member of the Board \\nfor signature, he recorded as under:\\n\\u201cI am having a dissenting view to above said order. I will \\npass detailed order on next date of hearing.\\u201d\\n15.1\\tThe matter was directed to be put up on 12.04.2022. On the \\nnext date, the Principal Magistrate being not there and another \\nperson having been appointed as a member of the Board, the \\narguments apparently were reheard by the two members of the \\nBoard in the absence of the Principal Magistrate, and it was \\ndirected that enquiry into the offence allegedly committed by \\nthe CCL is to be conducted by the Board.\\n15.2\\tSection 7 of the Act deals with the procedure in relation to \\nthe Board. Sub-Section 3 thereof provides that the Board may \\nact notwithstanding absence of any member of the Board. No \\norder passed by the Board shall be invalid by reason only of \\nabsence of any member during any stage of proceedings. The \\nproviso thereto provides that at the time of final disposal of \\nthe case or making an order under Section 18(3) of the Act, \\nthere shall be at least two members including the Principal \\nMagistrate.\\n15.3\\tWhen the arguments in the matter were heard with reference \\nto the order under Section 18(3) of the Act, and the order was \\nreserved on 29.03.2022 the Board consisted of a Principal \\nMagistrate and a Member.\\n15.4\\tSection 7(4) of the Act provides that in case there is any \\ndifference of opinion in the interim or the final disposal, the \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n809\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nopinion of the majority shall prevail. Where there is no such \\nmajority, the opinion of the Principal Magistrate shall prevail.\\n15.5\\tA perusal of the record shows that after the order was reserved \\non 29.03.2022, the matter was listed on 05.04.2022 for orders. \\nThe Principal Magistrate recorded his opinion that the CCL is to \\nbe tried by the Children\\u2019s Court. The other member of the Board \\nrecorded his dissent though, no detailed reasons were given as \\nsuch. In terms of Section 7(4) of the Act, the opinion of the majority \\nis to prevail. The case in hand does not fall in that category, as \\nthe Board on that date consisted of the Principal Magistrate and \\na Member, and the Member had recorded his dissent. In such a \\nsituation the opinion of the Principal Magistrate will prevail. In the \\ncase in hand the order was signed by the Principal Magistrate. \\nEven if the other member of the Board had not signed the order \\nand had merely mentioned that he had a dissenting view, without \\nany reasons being recorded, the order of the Principal Magistrate \\nwill prevail. Needless to add that reasons in any order are \\u2018heart \\nand soul\\u2019 and are helpful for the next higher Court to examine \\nthe matter. The proceedings with reference to the opinion of the \\nBoard regarding inquiry or trial of the CCL, either by the Board \\nor Children\\u2019s Court, stood culminated. Any further proceedings \\nin that matter were non-est and without jurisdiction. Much less \\nto say anything more about the same. The opinion of the High \\nCourt in that regard does not call for any interference.\\nVI.\\t REMEDY OF APPEAL TO APPELLANT\\n16.\\t In our opinion, considering the facts of the case in hand, the appellant \\ndeserves to be granted that right. \\n16.1\\tInitially the application filed by the complainant was rejected \\nby the Board. Aggrieved against the same, the complainant \\npreferred revision before the High Court. The High Court decided \\nthe same merely on the issue of finality of the opinion of the \\nBoard. It was in terms of Section 7(4) of the Act, which provides \\nthat where majority opinion is not possible, the opinion of the \\nPrincipal Magistrate shall prevail. An appeal is a valuable right. \\nThe arguments, if any, which the CCL may have against the \\norder dated 05.04.2022 passed by the Board directing for his \\ntrial by the Children\\u2019s Court, have not been considered. The \\nimpugned order only noticed as fact that the Board had formed \\n810\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nopinion after considering the opinion received from NIMHANS. \\nIf scheme of the Act is considered, an appeal against order of \\nthe Board passed under Section 15 of the Act lies to the Court \\nof Sessions. The appellate authority, to examine the issues, \\nis entitled to get the assistance of experienced psychologists \\nand medical specialists other than those whose assistance has \\nbeen obtained by the Board. Hence, independent examination \\nis envisaged. The said process has not been followed in the \\ncase in hand. We do not want to prejudice the rights of the \\nparties in that regard.\\n16.2\\tHence, we are of the opinion that the CCL can exercise his \\nright of appeal against order dated 05.04.2022 passed by the \\nBoard within 10 days and appeal, if any filed, shall be decided \\nby the appellate authority within two months thereafter.\\nVII.\\t ADDITIONAL ISSUES \\n17.\\t Before parting with the judgment, we quote with approval para \\n25 of the impugned order passed by the High Court. The same is \\nextracted below:\\n\\u201c25. One more point observed by this Court is that while \\nsigning the order sheet and also orders, the names of the \\nJudicial Member as well as Non-judicial Members are not \\nnoted below their signatures. This is coming in the way \\nof anyone knowing the names of the members who were \\npresent and who were absent. Therefore, only on the \\nbasis of signatures, this Court was able to distinguish as to \\nwho was the Non-Judicial Member present on 05.04.2022 \\nand who was the third member who joined in expressing \\ndissenting opinion on 12.04.2022. This Court is of the \\nconsidered opinion that it would be appropriate to mention \\nthe names of the members below their signatures, which \\nwould also help the transparency in conduct of the said \\nproceedings and put the members on guard about their \\nroles played in the said proceedings.\\u201d\\n17.1\\tThe High Court has noticed an important issue which arises in \\njudicial and quasi-judicial proceedings throughout the country. \\nThe Presiding Officers or Members of the Board, as the case in \\nhand, or Tribunals do not mention their names when the order \\nis passed. As a result of which it becomes difficult to find out \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R. \\b\\n811\\nChild in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. \\nThe State of Karnataka and Another\\nlater on, as to who was presiding the Court or Board or Tribunal \\nor was the member at the relevant point of time. There may be \\nmany officers with the same name. Insofar as the judicial officers \\nare concerned, unique I.D. numbers have been issued to them.\\n17.2\\tWe expect that wherever lacking, in all orders passed by the \\nCourts, Tribunals, Boards and the quasi-judicial authorities, the \\nnames of the Presiding Officers or the Members be specifically \\nmentioned in the orders when signed, including the interim \\norders. If there is any identification number given to the officers, \\nthe same can also be added. \\n17.3\\tThe matter does not rest here. In many of the orders the presence \\nof the parties and/or their counsels is not properly recorded. \\nFurther, it is not evident as to on whose behalf adjournment \\nhas been sought and granted. It is very relevant fact to be \\nconsidered at different stages of the case and also to find out \\nas to who was the party delaying the matter. At the time of \\ngrant of adjournment, it should specifically be mentioned as to \\nthe purpose therefor. This may be helpful in imposition of costs \\nalso, finally once we shift to the real terms costs. \\nVIII.\\t RELIEFS AND DIRECTIONS \\n18.\\t In view of our aforesaid discussions, the present appeal is disposed \\nof with the following directions:\\n(i)\\t\\nThe provision of Section 14(3) of the Act, providing for the period \\nof three months for completion of a preliminary assessment \\nunder Section 15 of the Act, is not mandatory. The same is held \\nto be directory. The period can be extended, for the reasons \\nto be recorded in writing, by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or, \\nas the case may be, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.\\n(ii)\\t\\nThe words \\u2018Children\\u2019s Court\\u2019 and \\u2018Court of Sessions\\u2019 in \\nJuvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \\nand the 2016 Rules shall be read interchangeably. Primarily \\njurisdiction vests in the Children\\u2019s Court. However, in the \\nabsence of constitution of such Children\\u2019s Court in the district, \\nthe power to be exercised under the Act is vested with the \\nCourt of Sessions.\\n(iii)\\t Appeal, under Section 101(2) of the Act against an order of \\nthe Board passed under Section 15 of the Act, can be filed \\n812\\b\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nwithin a period of 30 days. The appellate court can entertain \\nthe appeal after the expiry of the aforesaid period, provided \\nsufficient cause is shown.
